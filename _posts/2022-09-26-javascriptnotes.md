### Stuff we talked about

Krishiv:
- To create a table, we have to first define a function containing specific variables.
- We also have to define a JSON method asscoitiated with the function that we have created.
- All the variables that are in the "constructor" must be defined if they are included in the funcion


Shivansh:
- To add objects or instances of the function we have to use the "var" variable 
- To add multiople objects or instances of the function we can use an array which stores multiple lists
- In the end we also set a html function, in my case compsci.html

Complete:
- To finish off the function we must write in html to produce a table
