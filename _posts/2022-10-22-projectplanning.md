### Program Purpose and Function(krishiv)
- The purpose of this program is to be able to teach people about fitness and overall show how we can educate people on fitness with the people of the app.

### Data Abstraction(Prasith)
- The purpose of this is to have two seperate code segments which are not connected. One should show data being stored as a list and one should show data being used in the program function. 

### Managing Complexity (Shivansh)
- To manage Complexity in the we will manipulate the data so it gives us the sepcifc workout plan and diet needed after a the given input. We will use use specific methods as well as abstracting it using frontend techniques to make it more user-friendly.

### Procedural Abstraction(Advay)

- One parameter that affects the functionality of our procedure is our implementation of variables and inputs. These parameters allow us to take in information and use it to educate people on fitness. 

### Algorithm Implementation(Dhruva)
- We will use algorithms to calculate many statistics given inputs that the user provides. We will also use algorithms to create graphs and other ways to utilize the information calculated and provided for the users.

### Testing(krishiv)

- The way we will make people test it is by making them use the several inputs and test our calculator, and even enter the fitness course to see who will be able to get a correct result.
