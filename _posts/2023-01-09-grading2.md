### First Submission Being Graded
| Reporting Category      | Student Score | College Board Score     | Comments |

| Program Purpose and Function      |      0  |    0     |  There was no clear prupose set, all that was given was the function of the program. Also, they weren't clear about the inputs and outputs which made their program more confusing     |
|  Data Abstraction       |   0      |       0    |  There is no Data Abstraction being shown in the video. The list is not reduced at all and only met 1 of the criteria.
|   Managing Complexity   |    0   | 0      | The Managing Complexity is not showing the adquate criteria, because the data was never stored and the outputs were not given in the adequate criteria.
|  Procedural Abstraction      |     0   |       |
|   Algorithm Implementation           |    0        |         |
|   Testing   |     1 |     1 |       | They shows adquated amount of testing. Showing what happens when the correct input is given, and shows what hapens when the incorrect input is given.

| Program Purpose and Function      |   1     |      1   |  The answer is to specify the program's purpose as creative expression, "to explore the user's creativity through poetic expression  using  words and images. Formatting to generate some unique poems.      |
|  Data Abstraction       |      1   |       1    | Two different code segments are provided. The first shows the  data  stored in the identified list and the second shows the data  accessed under the new name from the identified list as it is passed as a parameter. |
|   Managing Complexity   |     1  |  1     | The response includes code that uses lists of words to manage complexity when generating |
|  Procedural Abstraction      |  1      | 1      | The answer explains what the program does, but not its purpose. Here's the answer: The program aims to determine the winner of a fictional battle between two Marvel-him characters based on which character's average is higher  in six categories. This failed the criteria for that row. |
|   Algorithm Implementation           |      1      |   1      | The answer explains in detail how the algorithm works in steps so it can be reconstructed. The answer says First define a variable that counts the number of verses generated sequentially, define an empty string, then do an iteration to generate something like this: A number of poems specified by the user  by going through a select statement specifying articlePoem or noArticlePoem each time. |

Here's the answer: The program aims to determine the winner of a fictional battle between two Marvel-him characters based on which character's average is higher  in six categories. This failed the criteria for that row.  |
|  Data Abstraction       |   1      |       1    | The response contains a list of six rankings of one character in the collection combined with image URLs, which are passed to a function that determines the winner and manages the complexity of the program code. The answer contains a detailed explanation of what would happen if the list weren't used |
|   Managing Complexity   |     1  |   1    | The response contains a created procedure findWinner with two parameters used in this procedure. The response also contains another code segment showing the call to the findWinner handler. The answer explains what the procedure does. |
|  Procedural Abstraction      |   1     |    1   | findWinner involves ordering, selection (if statements), and iteration (for loops). The answer explains in detail how the algorithm works in steps so it can be reconstructed. |
|   Algorithm Implementation           |      1      |  1       | findWinner involves ordering, selection (if statements), and iteration. The answer explains in detail how the algorithm works in steps so it can be reconstructed. |
|   Testing   |    1  |   1    |      The response describes two calls to the procedure with different arguments that result in different results of the procedure. The first call uses the Vision and Bishop arguments. The second call takes Carnage and Venom as arguments. The response describes the condition being tested for the two procedure calls. |

| Program Purpose and Function      |   1     |       1 |   They demonstrated running a program, collecting user input, and printing the output to the screen. It also explained the purpose and mechanics of the program and explained the inputs and outputs.   |
|  Data Abstraction       |   1      |       0| There are 0 student programs that did not meet all criteria for this row. They provided his two code segments, but the data stored in the list was not used, only the length of the list was accessed. |
|   Managing Complexity   |     0  |   0   | The project did not meet any of the requiered steps in criteria in the row, therefore the point was not given. |
|  Procedural Abstraction      |   1     |    1   | The project got a 1 because the student programs meet all criteria in this series. They included a student-developed procedure called isitcorrect with an explicit parameter checkanswer and a call to that procedure in her second code segment that took an answer argument. It also explained how the process works and how it contributes to the overall program. |
|   Algorithm Implementation           |      1      |  1       | This student's program met all the criteria for this series. They included student-developed algorithms in procedures involving ordering, selection (if statements), and iteration (repeating loops). We also detailed how the algorithm works, including iterations to check the position and accuracy of characters in user input. |
|   Testing   |    1  |   0    |    The student program passed all the necessary ctieria. They provided a flowchart that accurately represented the program's logic, including the use of iteration, selection, and ordering. We also discussed how flowcharts represent the logic of a program.   |
