### What I did bad in
- I wasn't very good at the binary coding and understanding the proramming methods.
- Psuedo code was also pretty hard to understand, comprehend, and then answer questions based off them
- I was also not very good at evaulting programs and testing them off through comprehensio questions.


### What I can do to improve
- What I can do to improve is start watching vidoes on binary reading and learn how and what to do in computational programmin.
- I can start to do more problems in psuedo code, to strength my knowledge of programming.

### Individual Questions that I did Wrong

- Question 2: I switched up true and false in the equation
- Question 20: I need to start working on bits and understanding memory
- Question 21: I need to learn about binary sequences
- Question 28: I exchanged variables within the question, so next time I need to be more careful
- Question 30: I didn't put in the correct benefit for list, to improve I will reasearch the benefits of using a list
-  Question 35: I didn't set the maxPS based on time, to improve on this I must read the directions more carfully.
- Question 36: I exchanged the evenlist or oddlist, to improve this  Ihave to be mroe careful.
- Question 43: I didn't read the entire question, and I missed the block part which was supposed to be repeated
