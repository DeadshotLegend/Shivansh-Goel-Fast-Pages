### 1st AP CSP Project that I saw

- This project was made by Noor, Steven, Ederick, Alan,, and Liav
- The basic overview of the program was: "A scheduling program that allows you to check the weather while displaying the eents that you want to host on a given day".
- Stuff that I liked: I really liked their idea and their aiblity to put it into fruition.
- Stuff that I didn't like: I didn't like their API and how it kind of related with their idea.
