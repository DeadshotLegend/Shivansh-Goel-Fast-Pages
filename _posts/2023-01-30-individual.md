### 5.1
Three advantages or disadvantages of CS:
Increased Efficiency and Productivity: On the one hand, computer technology has altered the way we communicate, handle data, and solve problems at work and in our daily lives. However, it has also resulted in job automation and the loss of many manual labor positions, which has reduced the number of employment prospects. Enhanced Information Access and Education: People may now access educational materials and information in ways that were before inconceivable because to the internet and computer technology. The dissemination of inaccurate and misleading information, as well as an increase in distractions and a shortening of attention spans, have all been impacted by this, though. Globalization and increased connectivity are on the rise. People may now connect and communicate in ways that were previously impractical, overcoming cultural and geographic barriers. Greater collaboration and understanding between various communities are the outcome of this, but it has also facilitated the spread of hate speech and cyberbullying and reduced in-person encounters.

### Dopamine Problems 
Having too much dopamine — or too much dopamine concentrated in some parts of the brain and not enough in other parts — is linked to being more competitive, aggressive and having poor impulse control. It can lead to conditions that include ADHD, binge eating, addiction and gambling.

### Digital Divide
The digital divide is the unequal access to digital technology, including smartphones, tablets, laptops, and the internet. The digital divide creates a division and inequality around access to information and resources. Digital Divide is an important part of our society because not everyone has the same resources to do work or have the same amount of entertainmnet as others. 

### Digital Empowerment
Computers can help students in school. Computer skills can lead to good jobs. Computers can be used to support personal interests and social life. Computers can help young people communicate with mentors.

### 5.2
Among the problems students have with controlling computational time is the problem of dopamine. Many problems are what I deal with because I don't have time to maintain my attention while I have to do my schoolwork. Because games give me more dopamine than school work, my brain prefers playing video games and it gives me that feeling/impulse more than looking at textbooks. One way  to avoid playing  is to set Screen Time to limit the amount of time you spend playing games. I also devoted a certain amount of time  to my studies each day.

### Blog Reflection
The Reflection for this assignment is that there are a lot of people that have different devices which can affect how people interact both online and in person. People can also be affected mentally and physically due to different dopmaine given through devices. There are a lot of benfits for computerr science but there are also a lot of cons for computer science.


### 5.3 Algorithmic Bias
<img src='{{ "/images/algorithmbias.PNG" | relative_url }}' width='480' alt='Changed theme to Architect'>
Algorithmic bias describes systematic and repeatable errors in computer systems that lead to "unfair" results such as: B. "Privilege" one category over another in a way that is different from the algorithm's intended function. Bias can arise from a number of factors including, but not limited to, unintended or unanticipated uses or choices regarding algorithm design, data encoding, collection, selection, or methods used to train the algorithm. . For example, algorithmic bias has been observed in search engine results and social media platforms. This stigma can have many effects, ranging from unintentional invasion of privacy to reinforcing social prejudices related to race, gender, sexuality, and ethnicity. Algorithmic bias studies are most interested in algorithms that reflect "systematic and unfair" discrimination. This bias has recently been addressed in legal frameworks such as the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (2018) and the proposed Artificial Intelligence Act (2021). 

### 5.4 Is there Discrimination in HP Computers
In the vidoe, the HP Computer was designed to track the face of a person and follow it around. But when it was tried out by a black man, it would not work on him. Then they tried the Comptuer on a white woman where the HP Computer did what it was supposed to do. A possible explanation for why there is such a divide is because maybe when the company tested out the comptuer they only tried it on subjects who were white so they did not get enough data compilation. A solution for this would be to incorporate more test subjecst of all different races so the comptuer recognizes all demonitions of the homo sapien species.

### Crowd - Sourcing
Some examples of us students Crown sourcing would be github. Crowd Sourcing has multiple advantages and disadvantages. Crowdsourcing involves a large group of dispersed participants contributing or producing goods or services—including ideas, votes, micro-tasks, and finances—for payment or as volunteers. Advantages of Croudsourcing would be that a large population could help each other by sharing important pieces of informatiosn such as nonfiction, fiction, and code. Some disadvantagse of Crowdsourcing would be that there is a lot of imporant information that should be limtied but it is inot. Also, the sharing of code on Github can lead to plagirlization as well as people not learning properlty because they can just look online or at other people's work in their various different projects. Lastly, one of the huggest disadvantage would be that there is a lot of available resources which is not supposed to be their which will only hinder the learning of the students in their various different classes.

###  5.5 Legal and Ethical Concerns
Copyright is important for making sure that other people do not have the ability to take your information. In the case of copyright ethics these issues include respect for the author's achievement, respect for property interests, and a recognition of the social claim to fruits of intellectual activity and the social right of free access to information. Fair use and copyright in educational institutions is largely an ethical issue. Ethics are not dependent on one individual's actions. All parties involved must contribute to the ethical nature of an event and must accept both the responsibility for their actions or their non-actions. Modifying an image and then displaying it on your company's website. Creating merchandise for sale which features copyrighted words or images. Downloading music or films without paying for their use. Copying any literary or artistic work without a license or written agreement. Obtaining a patent on processes for cloning human beings cannot it itself be an ethical problem. If it is unethical to clone human beings, it is the research that should be prevented, not the patent. There are three main types of ethical issues: Utilitarian, Deontological, and Virtue. Utilitarian ethics focus on the consequences of an action, while deontological ethics focus on the act itself. Virtue ethics focuses on the character of the person acting. Reasons why open source projects eventaully fail: Creative Differences – any open-source project worked on by two or more people risks facing a creative differences moment which, if not managed properly, could lead to a split, and the project being forked. And if the community is too fragmented after the split, both projects risk being abandoned.

### 5.5 Questions and Reflection:
In my opinion, copyright and the right to both property and intellectual property are both very importnat and deserve to be portected. It is important to make sure that people do not every interfere with other people's code and that everyone should be able to have a right to keep their property and intelllectual property for themselves for both privacy and monetary reasons. Not having these protections will create a toxic environment on the internet and will award cheating, plagiralism, which are not good stuff for society. Another question talked about how to control these copyright and stealing of intellectual stuff. I think that many new companies and legalized devices are stopping the spread of copyright and plagirilams which will help create a better environment for everyone and help remove toxicity and cheating form the internet which will help everyone.
That comes with a ton of advantages, including low-cost investment, better innovation, smarter learning, and easy bug removal tracking, and more. However, open-source software carries certain disadvantages as well, including no constant support, slighter riskiness, and non-friendly nature of the software.

###  5.6 Safe Computing
Computer security is important because it keeps your information protected. It's also important for your computer's overall health; proper computer security helps prevent viruses and malware, which allows programs to run quicker and smoother. Protect Yourself from Computer viruses, spyware, scams & spam. Computer viruses, spyware, and spam not only disrupt your work day with computer and network problems, but can result in identity theft. The main methods you can use to keep your computer safe are to have up to date antivirus and firewall programs, back up your data, use the Internet safely, protect your data by using secure connections and protecting sensitive data, and keep your computer and information safe by using strong passwords and controlling. Computing is any goal-oriented activity requiring, benefiting from, or creating computing machinery. It includes the study and experimentation of algorithmic processes, and development of both hardware and software. Computing has scientific, engineering, mathematical, technological and social aspects. Computer security has three main goals: Confidentiality: Making sure people cannot acquire information they should not (keeping secrets) Integrity: Making sure people cannot change information they should not (protecting data) Availability: Making sure people cannot stop the computer from doing its job. The Health and Safety (Display Screen Equipment) Regulations 1992 set out how employers should handle the risk of working with computer equipment. These regulations place obligations on employers whose employees use display screen equipment (e.g. computers and laptops) daily for continuous periods of an hour or more. Confidentiality, integrity and availability, also known as the CIA triad, is a model designed to guide policies for information security within an organization.

### 5.6 Questions And Reflection
There were many questions on about how was to stay safe on computing and on the internet. We talked about who was more vulnerable to different types of scam attacks or cyber intrusion. We came to the conclusion, that the leaset experienced you are the more likely of a chance that they will be able to get hacked. So for exmaple, older people, especialy the people who grew up without computers and/or technological devices and the younger generation (under 13) who don't have enough experience on computers to make importnat decisions for themselves. I came to the conclsuion that, there is no specific age where people are more vulenrable, it is really based off the experince they have with computer technological devices and/or jsut technological devices in general. People should not be judged by their age because they are plenty important computer scientists to this day which are part of the older generations. In conclusion, staying safe while computing and on the internet is directly corrleated to the experience in which peole have with computer devices and/or computer technological devices.
