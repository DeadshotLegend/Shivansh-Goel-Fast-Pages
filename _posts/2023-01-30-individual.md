### 5.1
Three advantages or disadvantages of CS:
Increased Efficiency and Productivity: On the one hand, computer technology has altered the way we communicate, handle data, and solve problems at work and in our daily lives. However, it has also resulted in job automation and the loss of many manual labor positions, which has reduced the number of employment prospects. Enhanced Information Access and Education: People may now access educational materials and information in ways that were before inconceivable because to the internet and computer technology. The dissemination of inaccurate and misleading information, as well as an increase in distractions and a shortening of attention spans, have all been impacted by this, though. Globalization and increased connectivity are on the rise. People may now connect and communicate in ways that were previously impractical, overcoming cultural and geographic barriers. Greater collaboration and understanding between various communities are the outcome of this, but it has also facilitated the spread of hate speech and cyberbullying and reduced in-person encounters.

### Dopamine Problems 
Having too much dopamine — or too much dopamine concentrated in some parts of the brain and not enough in other parts — is linked to being more competitive, aggressive and having poor impulse control. It can lead to conditions that include ADHD, binge eating, addiction and gambling.

### Digital Divide
The digital divide is the unequal access to digital technology, including smartphones, tablets, laptops, and the internet. The digital divide creates a division and inequality around access to information and resources. Digital Divide is an important part of our society because not everyone has the same resources to do work or have the same amount of entertainmnet as others. 

### Digital Empowerment
Computers can help students in school. Computer skills can lead to good jobs. Computers can be used to support personal interests and social life. Computers can help young people communicate with mentors.

### 5.2
Among the problems students have with controlling computational time is the problem of dopamine. Many problems are what I deal with because I don't have time to maintain my attention while I have to do my schoolwork. Because games give me more dopamine than school work, my brain prefers playing video games and it gives me that feeling/impulse more than looking at textbooks. One way  to avoid playing  is to set Screen Time to limit the amount of time you spend playing games. I also devoted a certain amount of time  to my studies each day.

### Blog Reflection
The Reflection for this assignment is that there are a lot of people that have different devices which can affect how people interact both online and in person. People can also be affected mentally and physically due to different dopmaine given through devices. There are a lot of benfits for computerr science but there are also a lot of cons for computer science.
