### 5.1
Three advantages or disadvantages of CS:
Increased Efficiency and Productivity: On the one hand, computer technology has altered the way we communicate, handle data, and solve problems at work and in our daily lives. However, it has also resulted in job automation and the loss of many manual labor positions, which has reduced the number of employment prospects. Enhanced Information Access and Education: People may now access educational materials and information in ways that were before inconceivable because to the internet and computer technology. The dissemination of inaccurate and misleading information, as well as an increase in distractions and a shortening of attention spans, have all been impacted by this, though. Globalization and increased connectivity are on the rise. People may now connect and communicate in ways that were previously impractical, overcoming cultural and geographic barriers. Greater collaboration and understanding between various communities are the outcome of this, but it has also facilitated the spread of hate speech and cyberbullying and reduced in-person encounters.

Among the problems students have with controlling computational time is  the problem of dopamine. Many problems are what I deal with because I don't have time to maintain my attention while I have to do my schoolwork. Because games give me more dopamine than school work, my brain prefers playing video games and it gives me that feeling/impulse more than looking at textbooks. One way  to avoid playing  is to set Screen Time to limit the amount of time you spend playing games. I also devoted a certain amount of time  to my studies each day.
