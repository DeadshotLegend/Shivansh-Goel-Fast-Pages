### First Submission Being Graded
| Reporting Category      | Student Score | College Board Score     | Comments |
| :---        |    :----:   |          :---: |  ---: |
| Program Purpose and Function     |    1 |    1   | All the criteria were met, they explicity talked about the program purpose which was to eneterntain and to make decisions also they showed the function and how the inputs and outputs which were given.  |
| Data Abstraction   |   0    |       0   |  Not all the criteria were met as the submission did not include data being used or transferred from the second list.|
|   Managing Complexity  |    0   | 0   |  The user got a 1 for Managing COmplexity because the code that was showed and the explanation met the criteria.
|  Proceudral Abstraction  |     0   |  0|  The user had multiple different procedures including "rpsGame", and "yourPlay", but failed to describe how the procedure helps to contribute to the overall program. |
|  Algorithm Implementation  |    -1      |    1    | - |
|   Testing   |     1 |     1 |   The user did the necessary criteria for coding because of all the stuff that was necessary was included   |

### Second Submission Being Graded
| Reporting Category      | Student Score | College Board Score     | Comments |
| :---        |    :----:   |          :---: |  ---: |
| Program Purpose and Function     |    1 |    1   | The user got a 1 on the program prupose and function becausde it explecitly described the purpose and function.    |
| Data Abstraction   |   1   |     1    |  The user got a 1 on the program purpose and function because they didd the neccessary criteria for data asbstraction by showing data being transferred or being used.|
|   Managing Complexity  |   1   |  1     | The letOfGuessWord list is used to make it more efficient. Otherwise, you would have to create five more variables.
|  Proceudral Abstraction  |    1   |  1    |  The user met the criteria for the procedural abstraction because it included the neccessary criterai and steps. |
|  Algorithm Implementation  |    1       |    1     | The algorithm is in the createPoems function and includes all three: Sequencing, Iteration (Running), and Selection (Running). The answer explains in detail how the algorithm can be recreated. |
|   Testing   |     1 |     1 |   The test describes the output of two calls containing 1 and h in the word hello. The first call returns false and the second call returns true.   |



### Third Submission Being Graded
| Reporting Category      | Student Score | College Board Score     | Comments |
| :---        |    :----:   |          :---: |  ---: |
| Program Purpose and Function     |      1 |    1   | The Purpose and the function are stated and the explanation met all the cireteria required.   |
| Data Abstraction   |   0    |       0  |  There is a list called stateList which stores the data thus meeting the necessary criteria for Data Abstraction. |
|   Managing Complexity  |    0   | 0     | The user did not exlain why using a list is the simplest way. 
|  Proceudral Abstraction  |     0   |  0     | The procedure "updateScreen" has no paramter therefore not meeting the neccessary criteria for the subject. |
|  Algorithm Implementation  |    0       |    0     |    Does not include iteration therefore does not meet the neccessary criteria for the subject.  |
|   Testing   |     0 |     0 |   Not enough conditiosn were tested by the user therfore does not meet the neccessary criteria for the subject.    |



### Fourth Submission Being Graded
| Reporting Category      | Student Score | College Board Score     | Comments |
| :---        |    :----:   |          :---: |  ---: |
| Program Purpose and Function     |      1 |    1   | The user clearly defined the program purpose and function    |
| Data Abstraction   |   1     |       1   |  The fishTypes list is set and called to represent the type and number of fish caught. |
|   Managing Complexity  |    1  | 1      | The neccessary criteria for managing complexity is met because the code and the explanation shows the neccessary criteria.
|  Proceudral Abstraction  |     1   |  1     | The correct and accurate paramaters are set for the various procedures that are in the code. |
|  Algorithm Implementation  |    1       |    1     |   The user met the neccessary criteria for algorithm implementation becasue there is inputs and outputs in the algorithms and methods that are provided the in the code and explanation.  |
|   Testing   |     0 |    0 |   The user did not meet the criteria for the testing subject because they did not show enough scenarios or trials for different inputs and outputs.    |

### Reflection 3
I think that I am getting better at regonizing mistakes in the program puprose and function as well as testing compared to my previous tries. I also think that I need to start getting better at recognizing mistakes in procedural asbstraction and recognizing paramter and procedural errors.
