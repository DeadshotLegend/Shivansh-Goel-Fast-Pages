### The thoughts and ideas before creating the quiz

- We decided to create a quiz about a video game
- We reviewed the incomplete program given and we figuredo that we should add something which would tell if one got the answer wrong

### Quiz Creation
- The onEvent function will be used and the variable used will be console.log: "message"

### During or After finished the quiz
- Trying for loops was very difficult 
- Initiliazing a variable wasn't working until we set it as a global variable
- If, else if, and else statements came in handy in the scoring process

### Stuff which I did differnet than normal quiz
- I added if, else if, and else statements to add up the points
- I added pictures and transitions
- I also added audio to the clip if one got it correct
