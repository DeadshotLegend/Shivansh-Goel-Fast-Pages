### 1st AP CSP Project That I saw

- Rachit Jaiswal project was about using 


### 2nd AP CSP Project That I saw
- This project was represented by Krishiv Mahendru
- This purpose of the project was to show different retail houses and which ones are the msot compatible using different data statistics
- Some of the data statistics include proximity, cost of the house, and many different compatibility issues that people look into when buying a house.
- The code was equally split and the part Krishiv represented was how he used different cost compariosns to privde the user "me" with properties which follow the criteria of the cost.

- This project was presented by Shaurya Goel, included members of Vardaan, Navan, and Justin.
- This purpose of the project was to allows users to compare different nfl teams and also allows the user to predict the outcome of a particular match. It also offers a visually appealing table where you can see in-depth team statistics for all the different teams. It also has create, update and delete properties.
- The program allows you to select two different NFL teams (Team + Challenger) from a dropdown menu. When two teams are selected from either menu, the algorithm instantly compares both teams' stats and shows which team is more likely to win, along with each team's individual stats side-by-side. increase.
- The other people in the project also completed something called a fact API.
- Overall I think that this project was very well done and very well coordinated and that it worked very well.

### Reflection
Preparing for the Project was hard
