Sequential Search: Although for selection sort is seemingly fast for smaller inputs, it is clear that it cannot keep up with increasing input sizes. Because every value in the provided array is checked using sequential search, the algorithm&#39;s overall runtime grows &quot;linearly&quot; with the input size. Checking for the worst-case situation, where runtime is maximized, can help us assess the sequential search method. This is because we need to be able to guarantee an upper bound or certain length of time for our program to complete executing while evaluating the effectiveness of our algorithm. To do this, we&#39;ll try to find the array&#39;s final element. | Binary Search: A SORTED list may be efficiently iterated over to find a specified value using binary search. This is accomplished by determining if the desired value is larger than or less than the list&#39;s middle value. You can now understand the necessity of sorting the desired list. This reasoning is faulty if the list is not sorted, and the binary search technique will no longer function.Binary search does not look for a match before moving on to the next element, unlike sequential search. The algorithm decides whether the selected element is bigger or smaller than the target in every iteration. | . Notes for Devolping Algorithms Python and Javascript . Different techniques of writing algorithms can nonetheless get the same results. Similar-looking algorithms can provide different results. Numerous algorithms can be employed to tackle the same issue. Example of A python Algoirthm: temp = 95 if (temp &gt;= 90): print(&quot;it is too hot outside&quot;) else: if (temp &gt;= 65): print(&quot;I will go outside&quot;) else: print(&quot;it is too cold outside&quot;) . Review . if-else statements . Syntax: . if (condition) { } else if (condition 2) { } else { } . for loops . for (let i = number; i &lt; number; i++) { // code } . Conditionals vs Booleans . Conditionals and booleans can be equivalent. . For example, let&#39;s say there are two booleans: rainy and sunny. . Let&#39;s look at the following code: . sunny = true; rainy = false; . false . if (sunny) { umbrella = false; } else if (rainy) { umbrella = true; } else { umbrella = false; } console.log(umbrella); . false . The code above is the same as below: . umbrella = !sunny &amp;&amp; rainy; console.log(umbrella); . false . To determine if two conditionals and booleans are the same, you can substitute the four possibilities that the two booleans (sunny and rainy) can be (listed below) into the conditional and boolean and see if both cases match: . sunny = true, rainy = true . sunny = true, rainy = false . sunny = false, rainy = true . sunny = false, rainy = false . Searching Introduction . Introduction to the binary search algorithm, it&#39;s uses, advantages, and disadvantages . toc:true - badges: true | comments: true | . What is searching? . In certain computer programs and applications, one might find the need to locate and retrieve a data value and/or it&#39;s index. Searching algorithms could be done in either intervals or sequences, and certain algorithms could be more efficient than others, with benefits and drawbacks to each. . The Naive Approach . The most intuitively obvious solution to the searching problem is to sequentialy check each successful value in the data structure until either a matching value is found, or the entire structure has been transversed. This thought process could be explained graphically in this example . This algorithm could also be expressed in code, as shown below. . def sequentialSearch(arr, target): N = len(arr) # Declare N as length of array for i in range(N): # Iterate over the list if arr[i] == target: # Check for match return i # Match found, return index and end function call return -1 # Element not found . Sequential Search - Larger Inputs . Although for selection sort is seemingly fast for smaller inputs, it is clear that it cannot keep up with increasing input sizes. Because sequential search checks every value of the given array, the algorithm&#39;s overall runtime increases &quot;linearly&quot; with the input size. . i.e. Pretend that one check takes one second, and that we are searching for the last element in an array. If the array length is 4, it would take 4 seconds to find the last element, whereas if the array length is 86400 indices long, it would take a whole day to find the element. . Hence, although selection sort is known for its simplicity, it is unfeasible for large inputs . Below, we have created three sorted lists of length 100,1000000,100000000. . import time arr1 = [i for i in range(100)] arr2 = [i for i in range(1000000)] arr3 = [i for i in range(100000000)] . To analyze the sequential search algorithm, we will check for the worst case scenario, where runtime is maximized. This is because when measuring the efficiency of our algorithm, we want to be able to guarantee an upper limit or set amount of time for our program to finish running. To do this, we will attempt to search for the last element in the array . print(&quot;length of list: &quot;, len(arr1)) s = time.time() print(&quot;Index: &quot;, sequentialSearch(arr1,99)) e = time.time() print(&#39;Execution time:&#39;, (e-s)*1000, &#39;ms&#39;) . length of list: 100 Index: 99 Execution time: 0.05602836608886719 ms . print(&quot;length of list: &quot;, len(arr2)) s = time.time() print(&quot;Index: &quot;, sequentialSearch(arr2,999999)) e = time.time() print(&#39;Execution time:&#39;, (e-s)*1000, &#39;ms&#39;) . length of list: 1000000 Index: 999999 Execution time: 58.67457389831543 ms . print(&quot;length of list: &quot;, len(arr3)) s = time.time() print(&quot;Index: &quot;, sequentialSearch(arr3,99999999)) e = time.time() print(&#39;Execution time:&#39;, (e-s)*1000, &#39;ms&#39;) . length of list: 100000000 Index: 99999999 Execution time: 5162.384986877441 ms . As you can see, as the input list grows larger and larger, the overall runtime of the program increases linearly as well, resulting in a lower scalability for the sequential search algorithm. . Binary Search . Binary search is an efficient way to iterate through a SORTED list to find a requested value. This is done through checking the middle value of a list and checking if the requested value is greater than or less than the middle value. You can start to see why the requested list must be sorted. If the list is not sorted, this logic is flawed, and the binary search algorithm will no longer work. . Unlike the sequential search method, binary search doesn&#39;t check for each successive element until a match is found. In every iteration the algorithm is making a binary decision; if the selected element is larger or smaller than the target. . How exactly does this work? Lets look at these amazing ms paint drawings: . i was too lazy to make a third so ur gonna have to live with 2 :) . This algorithm is extremely efficient as the maximum number of cycles in binary search is equal to log base 2 of the closest, next power of two, to length of list. . If the array is 8 items long, the maximum possible cycles would be 3 (log base 2 of 8 is 3) . If the array is 7 items long, the maximum possible cycles would STILL be 3 as the closest power of 2 to 7 is 8. . If the array is 9 items long, the maximum possible cycles INCREASES to 4, as the closest, next power of two, is 16. . def binarySearch(array, target): # Parameters: array is the given array and target is what we are looking for low = 0 # the starting lower bound high = len(array)-1 # the starting upper bound while high &gt;= low: # we will keep running until we run out of possible subarrays... mid = (high + low) // 2 # define the middle of the list to be the item at the index of the average of the lower and upper bound if array[mid] == target: # if item is in the middle of the list... we found what we are looking for! return mid # therefore, we return the index of where we found the item. elif array[mid] &gt; target: # if item is less than the middle of the list, this must mean that the item is on the lower half of the list high = mid-1 # therefore, we set the upper bound of the search to be the last item of the lower half else: # if item is neither less than or equal to the middle of the list, this must mean that the item is on the upper half of the list low = mid+1 # therefore, we set the lower bound of the search to be the first item of the upper half # if nothing is returned by the time the while loop ends, that means item MUST be missing from list return False # therefore we tell the user that the requested item was not found . Likewise, we can also take a recursive approach to this problem, note the similarities . def BinarySearchRecursion(arr, target, lo, hi): if lo &gt; hi: return False mid = (lo+hi)//2 if arr[mid] == target: return mid elif arr[mid] &gt; target: return BinarySearchRecursion(arr, target, lo, mid-1) elif arr[mid] &lt; target: return BinarySearchRecursion(arr, target, mid+1, hi) . Now, let&#39;s compare the runtime with the same lists we tried with the sequential search algorithm. . print(&quot;length of list: &quot;, len(arr1)) s = time.time() print(&quot;Index: &quot;, binarySearch(arr1,99)) e = time.time() print(&#39;Execution time:&#39;, (e-s)*1000, &#39;ms&#39;) . length of list: 100 Index: 99 Execution time: 0.05507469177246094 ms . print(&quot;length of list: &quot;, len(arr2)) s = time.time() print(&quot;Index: &quot;, binarySearch(arr2,999999)) e = time.time() print(&#39;Execution time:&#39;, (e-s)*1000, &#39;ms&#39;) . length of list: 1000000 Index: 999999 Execution time: 0.17070770263671875 ms . print(&quot;length of list: &quot;, len(arr3)) s = time.time() print(&quot;Index: &quot;, binarySearch(arr3,99999999)) e = time.time() print(&#39;Execution time:&#39;, (e-s)*1000, &#39;ms&#39;) . length of list: 100000000 Index: 99999999 Execution time: 0.06628036499023438 ms . arr4 = [1,4,5,8,10,13,145,1938] print(&quot;Index: &quot;, binarySearch(arr4,17)) . Index: False . Run the very last code segment below to load test cases and submission function . Developing Algorithms . toc: true | badges: true | comments: true | . Algorithms can be written in different ways and still accomplish the same tasks. Algorithms that look similar often yield differnet outputs. To solve the same problem, many different algorithms can be used. . Therefore, algorithms are very important for programmers, and today we&#39;re going to explore how to determine the outcome of algorithms, how to deteremine the output of similar algorithms, how to edit existing algorithms, and how to develop our own algorithms. . Determine the outcome of algorithms . Consider the following algorithm. . def mystery(num, num2): if (num % num2 == 0): print(&quot;True&quot;) else: print(&quot;False&quot;) mystery(20, 4) . True . What does the algorithm do? Please explain in words. | What if I put in 30 as num and 4 as num2. What would be the output? | The algorithm defines a function with two variables num and num2. Then there is an if and else statement where if num1 divded by num2 has no remainder then it will print true and if it does not it will print false. . If you put 30 as num, and 4 as num 2, the output would be False . Determine the outcome of similar algorithms . The output of this algorithm is &quot;It is too hot ouside&quot; . temp = 95 if (temp &gt;= 90): print(&quot;it is too hot outside&quot;) else: if (temp &gt;= 65): print(&quot;I will go outside&quot;) else: print(&quot;it is too cold outside&quot;) . it is too hot outside . The output of this algorithm includes another line which says &quot;i will go outside&quot; . temp = 95 if (temp &gt;= 90): print(&quot;it is too hot outside&quot;) if (temp &gt;= 65): print(&quot;i will go outside&quot;) if (temp &lt; 65): print(&quot;it is too cold outside&quot;) . it is too hot outside i will go outside . Editing Algorithms . Task: Please edit the algorithm above to have it yield the same results as the previous algorithm! (no matter what temp you put in) . Developing Algorithms . To develop algorithms, we first need to understand what the question is asking. Then, think about how you would approach it as a human and then try to find what pattern you went through to arrive at the answer. Apply this to code, and there you have it! An algorithm! . Let&#39;s say you wanted to sum up the first five integers. How would you do this in real life? Your thought process would probably be: . The sum of the first integer is 1. | Then, increase that integer by 1. I now add 2 to my existing sum (1). My new sum is 3. | Repeat until I add 5 to my sum. The resulting sum is 15. | . Now let&#39;s translate this into code. . sum = 0 # start with a sum of 0 for i in range (1, 6): # you will repeat the process five times for integers 1-5 sum = sum + i # add the number to your sum print(sum) # print the result . 15 . Task: Write an algorithm in python that sums up the first 5 odd integers. You can use the following code as a starter. . sum = 0 counter = 1 for i in range (0, 5): sum = sum + counter counter = counter + 2 print(sum) . 25 . Challenges and Homework . You have one homework problem. . Yes just one. . Don&#39;t get excited though. . Problem: Given a specific integer N, return the square root of N (R) if N is a perfect square, otherwise, return the square root of N rounded down to the nearest integer . Input: N (Integer) . Output: R (Integer) . Constraints: Do not use any built-in math operations such as sqrt(x) or x**(0.5), Try complete the problem in logarithmic time. . Hint 1: Maybe you can use Binary Search to try and reduce the number of checks you have to perform? . Hint 2: Is there a mathematical pattern amongst numbers and their square roots that could help you reduce the number of searches or iterations you must execute? Is there some value or rule you can set before applying binary search to narrow the range of possible values? . ALL THE CHALLENGES AND HOMEWORK ARE NOW HERE . def sqrt(num): if num == 0 or num == 1: return num start = 1 end = num while start &lt;= end: value = (start + end) // 2 if value*value == num: return value if value*value &lt; num: start = value + 1 else: end = value - 1 return end . from math import sqrt as sq test_cases = [0,1,4,85248289,22297284,18939904,91107025,69122596,9721924,37810201,1893294144,8722812816,644398225] answers = [int(sq(x)) for x in test_cases] def checkValid(): for i in range(len(test_cases)): if sqrt(test_cases[i]) == answers[i]: print(&quot;Check number {} passed&quot;.format(i+1)) else: print(&quot;Check number {} failed&quot;.format(i+1)) checkValid() .

Overview . As we&#39;ve seen in Unit 4.1, an IP address is a 32 bit number that uniquely identifies each device. (See this for . a recap). Something extra is that an IP address also comes with a subnet mask. A subnet mask is also a 32 bit number that identifies what network an IP address in in through a process that uses the bitwise AND. . In ANDing: . 0 + 0 = 0 . 0 + 1 = 0 . 1 + 0 = 0 . 1 + 1 = 1 . The following are the steps to determine the network that an IP address is in given the subnet mask: . Example: IP address: 192.168.0.1 . Subnet mask: 255.255.255.0 . Convert the IP address into binary: 192.168.0.1 -&gt; 11000000.10101000.00000000.00000001 | Convert the subnet mask into binary: 255.255.255.0 -&gt; 11111111.11111111.11111111.00000000 | Do a bitwise AND operation on the binary IP address and subnet mask: | 11000000.10101000.00000000.00000001 +11111111.11111111.11111111.00000000 =11000000.10101000.00000000.00000000 . Convert the result back to decimal: 11000000.10101000.00000000.00000000 -&gt; 192.168.0.0 | The network address is 192.168.0.0 . function binary(dec1) { bin2 = &quot;&quot; num = 7 while (num &gt;= 0) { if (dec1 % (2 ** num) == dec1) { bin = bin + &quot;0&quot; num -= 1 } else { bin2 = bin2 + &quot;1&quot; num -= 1 } } } function and (ip, mask) { ipdots = [0] maskdots = [0] for (let i = 0; i &lt; ip.length; i++) { if (ip[i] == &quot;.&quot;) { ipdots.push(i) } } for (let i = 0; i &lt; mask.length; i++) { if (mask[i] == &quot;.&quot;) { maskdots.push(i) } } ipdots.push(ip.length) maskdots.push(mask.length) console.log(ipdots) console.log(maskdots) } . Cell In[2], line 1 function binary(dec1) { ^ SyntaxError: invalid syntax . What I tried to complete . I tried to create a code which would measure the length of the of the ip subnet mask that I wanted to convert to binary and set up an algorithm to convert it into binary, but I did&#39;t have the methodology of solving it with javascript. | .",

What are procedures? . Fill in the blanks please: . Procedure: is a named group of programming instructions that may have parameters and return values. . Parameters: input values of a procedure. . Arguments: specify the values of the parameters when a procedure is called . Modularity: Modularity is a measure of the structure of networks or graphs which measures the strength of division of a network into modules. . Procedural Abstraction: Procedural abstraction is when we write code sections which are generalised by having variable parameters. . What are some other names for procedures?: Some other names for procedures include function in python. . Why are procedures effective?: Procedures are effective because for seperate values you don&#39;t have to create new codes but just replace the paramaters within the procedure. .

This includes demonstrating program objectives and functionality, managing complexity, using algorithms and procedures, testing, and providing detailed explanations to demonstrate proficiency in projects and the AP CSP curriculum. . For the college board requirement I will be creating the code which takes counts the points and if there is positive or negatie points depending on the object which is clikced. Random foods will come on the screen and if the correct objects are clicked then the points will increase if the wrong foods come on the screen than the points will decrease. . The overall plan for creating this project is to create a fun entertainment activity which can help people with their daily life(stresses). We are planning to create different parts of the project and different procedures to make this product a workable reality. We will have weekly meetings and also have a communication center in either slack or discord. This will make sure that we can hold each other accoutnable for completing our assignments. Teamwork will be very important in our project building and to create a good project. . The game will work when the user logs in and/or signs up, then the user will select start and start playing right away. The user must click on “good objects” which give points and avoid blicking on “bad objects” which takes away points. .",

            "title": "Individual MCQ Test Reflection",
            "content": "I missed 17 Questions, which were mostly bad interperations of code and not following the directions carefully. I also lost points on many non-code questions but about specific topics. . Question 7 . For Question 7 I did not read the correct order of the code so I put it in the wrong way. I put B instead of A which was initialized in a different code and in a different order. To avoid future mistakes I must read the instuctions more clearly and make sure that I do not make the same mistake. To not overthink it is best to follow what you really think is right the first time and only change the answer if there is sufficient evidence that it is not correct. . Question 13 . I did not put the correcrt order for this one, it said age&gt;16 and age&lt;18 but that was not the correct order. The other two options had the correct order for the criteria, but I did not look at the other ones as I thought that answer that I put was correct. TO avoid making the same mistake I must look at all the criteria and try ot find the best answer for the avialable options which meet the criteria instead of looking for the first one which makes kind of sense. . Question 15 . For this question I did not put the grayed box in the correct place because I forgot about an if block which would effect both the arrow and the grey block. The correct answer was “b”, which was where the greyed box was right but I selected “c” which was where the greyed box was at the wrong place. To avoid future Mistakes I will make sure to iterate correctly and also try to do the question multiple times. . Question 17 . For Question 17 the correct answer was “A” which showed the correct order of the code, but I selected “B” which had two IF statements whic were not neccessary for this question.For this Question I said that the input can be true and false but the answer was that “the input could only be true”, I made this mistake because I felt like that there could be a way to get false but I overthinked which led me to get the problem wrong. For the future I will not overthink these types of problems. . Question 24 . We put the value of the code as y^3, but the answer was just 3y, because I did not read the code correctly and I put 3 as the power of y instead of the multiplier. To avoid these future mistakes I will make sure to read the code in the correct way. Also, I must look at all the different criteria and avaialbe options to make srue that I do not skip any crucial parts of the question. . Question 26 . I put answer B which made the arrow facing downwards which was wrong becasuse it was answer A, I made this mistake because I did not understand how to do the problem. But now I have learned and to make sure I don’t make the same mistake in the future I will make sure to review this topic. . Question 27 . For Question 27, I did not read the code correctly and I put A instead of D which was wrong. For future occurences I should pay attention to the different if else statements as well as the different ways codes are changed. Also to avoid future mistakes I will make sure not to overthink problems and anaylze the criteria right away and when I make a decision to be correct I will not change it unless there is suffficient evidence. . Question 28 . For this question, I selected “B” which showed the code as “Repeate 2 Times with a couple of rotates” which were in the wrong order. I should have selected “c” which had a Repeate 2 Times with a “Repeate Times Loop” within the code. For Question 28, I made the same error that I made in Question 27. To avoid making the same mistake I should pay attention to the various pieces of code to find the best suitable code which works. . Question 30 . I put B and D but the correct answers would be B and C. I did not put C because I did not read the code correctly as well as putting D because I thought that this code would work for the Question. . Question 33 . For Qestion 33 Algorithm 2 works correctly but Algoirthm 1 does not work correctly, but I put both of them working correctly. The main mistake would most likely be that I overthinked the problem which led me to put on an extra solution which I should have not put. . Question 36 . For Question 36, I put that it intends to put the amount of times target is showns but I did it wrong. Instead of putting it correctly, what really happened was that I did not read the code correclty and I also overthinked the problem. To avoid future mistakes I will make sure that to read carefully and multiple times. . Quesiton 38 . For Question 38, I put “The procedure returns true when the initial value of number is greater than 2, and it otherwise returns false.”, but the correct output would be “The procedure returns true when the initial value of number is greater than 2, and it otherwise returns false.” This happened because I overthinked the problem and said that the procedure would return when the initial value when it is greater than 2 but I forgot the other important pieces of code that were in the problem. . Question 41 . For Question 41, I did put only one option which was A, but I did not put the second option which was D. I did this because I thought there was only supposed to be one answer instead of a “click that all aplly”. To avoid future mistakes I will make sure to read the directions carefully and multiple times to make sure I do not make the same mistake ever again. . Question 42 . For Question 42, I put 1 and 2 which were both correct but I did not put 3. All of them were correct but I overthinked the problem and only put 1 and 2 because I felt that not all of them could have been correct. To avoid future mistakes I will only focus on the code and not on other tangibles. To not overthink it is best to follow what you really think is right the first time and only change the answer if there is sufficient evidence that it is not correct. . Question 43 . For Question 43, I put “A program that encrypts a folder of digital files”, but the correct answer was “A program that finds the shortest driving route between two locations on a map”. This mainly happened because I was not informed about the topic enough “simulations” To avoid these types of future mistakes I must understand the topic way more than I have understood right now. . Question 44 . For Question 44, the answer was “The simulation will not produce usable results because actual customer data are not available.”, but I put another answer because I was not informed about the topic “simulations”. To make sure that I avoid making the same mistake I will learn more about simulations. . Question 49 . For Question 49, I put “Every problem can be solved with an algorithm for all possible inputs, but some will take more than 100 years, even with the fastest possible computer.”, but the correct answer was “There exist problems that no algorithm will ever be able to solve for all possible inputs.” I did not do this correctly but I was not informed about the topic, to make sure I avoid the same mistake I will learn more about the topic .",

            "title": "Individual 5.1 and 5.2 blogging",
            "content": "5.1 . Three advantages or disadvantages of CS: Increased Efficiency and Productivity: On the one hand, computer technology has altered the way we communicate, handle data, and solve problems at work and in our daily lives. However, it has also resulted in job automation and the loss of many manual labor positions, which has reduced the number of employment prospects. Enhanced Information Access and Education: People may now access educational materials and information in ways that were before inconceivable because to the internet and computer technology. The dissemination of inaccurate and misleading information, as well as an increase in distractions and a shortening of attention spans, have all been impacted by this, though. Globalization and increased connectivity are on the rise. People may now connect and communicate in ways that were previously impractical, overcoming cultural and geographic barriers. Greater collaboration and understanding between various communities are the outcome of this, but it has also facilitated the spread of hate speech and cyberbullying and reduced in-person encounters. . . Dopamine Problems . Having too much dopamine — or too much dopamine concentrated in some parts of the brain and not enough in other parts — is linked to being more competitive, aggressive and having poor impulse control. It can lead to conditions that include ADHD, binge eating, addiction and gambling. . Digital Divide . The digital divide is the unequal access to digital technology, including smartphones, tablets, laptops, and the internet. The digital divide creates a division and inequality around access to information and resources. Digital Divide is an important part of our society because not everyone has the same resources to do work or have the same amount of entertainmnet as others. . Digital Empowerment . Computers can help students in school. Computer skills can lead to good jobs. Computers can be used to support personal interests and social life. Computers can help young people communicate with mentors. . 5.2 . Among the problems students have with controlling computational time is the problem of dopamine. Many problems are what I deal with because I don’t have time to maintain my attention while I have to do my schoolwork. Because games give me more dopamine than school work, my brain prefers playing video games and it gives me that feeling/impulse more than looking at textbooks. One way to avoid playing is to set Screen Time to limit the amount of time you spend playing games. I also devoted a certain amount of time to my studies each day. . Blog Reflection . The Reflection for this assignment is that there are a lot of people that have different devices which can affect how people interact both online and in person. People can also be affected mentally and physically due to different dopmaine given through devices. There are a lot of benfits for computerr science but there are also a lot of cons for computer science. . 5.3 Algorithmic Bias . Algorithmic bias describes systematic and repeatable errors in computer systems that lead to “unfair” results such as: B. “Privilege” one category over another in a way that is different from the algorithm’s intended function. Bias can arise from a number of factors including, but not limited to, unintended or unanticipated uses or choices regarding algorithm design, data encoding, collection, selection, or methods used to train the algorithm. . For example, algorithmic bias has been observed in search engine results and social media platforms. This stigma can have many effects, ranging from unintentional invasion of privacy to reinforcing social prejudices related to race, gender, sexuality, and ethnicity. Algorithmic bias studies are most interested in algorithms that reflect “systematic and unfair” discrimination. This bias has recently been addressed in legal frameworks such as the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (2018) and the proposed Artificial Intelligence Act (2021). . 5.4 Is there Discrimination in HP Computers . In the vidoe, the HP Computer was designed to track the face of a person and follow it around. But when it was tried out by a black man, it would not work on him. Then they tried the Comptuer on a white woman where the HP Computer did what it was supposed to do. A possible explanation for why there is such a divide is because maybe when the company tested out the comptuer they only tried it on subjects who were white so they did not get enough data compilation. A solution for this would be to incorporate more test subjecst of all different races so the comptuer recognizes all demonitions of the homo sapien species. . Crowd - Sourcing . Some examples of us students Crown sourcing would be github. Crowd Sourcing has multiple advantages and disadvantages. Crowdsourcing involves a large group of dispersed participants contributing or producing goods or services—including ideas, votes, micro-tasks, and finances—for payment or as volunteers. Advantages of Croudsourcing would be that a large population could help each other by sharing important pieces of informatiosn such as nonfiction, fiction, and code. Some disadvantagse of Crowdsourcing would be that there is a lot of imporant information that should be limtied but it is inot. Also, the sharing of code on Github can lead to plagirlization as well as people not learning properlty because they can just look online or at other people’s work in their various different projects. Lastly, one of the huggest disadvantage would be that there is a lot of available resources which is not supposed to be their which will only hinder the learning of the students in their various different classes. . . 5.5 Legal and Ethical Concerns . Copyright is important for making sure that other people do not have the ability to take your information. In the case of copyright ethics these issues include respect for the author’s achievement, respect for property interests, and a recognition of the social claim to fruits of intellectual activity and the social right of free access to information. Fair use and copyright in educational institutions is largely an ethical issue. Ethics are not dependent on one individual’s actions. All parties involved must contribute to the ethical nature of an event and must accept both the responsibility for their actions or their non-actions. Modifying an image and then displaying it on your company’s website. Creating merchandise for sale which features copyrighted words or images. Downloading music or films without paying for their use. Copying any literary or artistic work without a license or written agreement. Obtaining a patent on processes for cloning human beings cannot it itself be an ethical problem. If it is unethical to clone human beings, it is the research that should be prevented, not the patent. There are three main types of ethical issues: Utilitarian, Deontological, and Virtue. Utilitarian ethics focus on the consequences of an action, while deontological ethics focus on the act itself. Virtue ethics focuses on the character of the person acting. Reasons why open source projects eventaully fail: Creative Differences – any open-source project worked on by two or more people risks facing a creative differences moment which, if not managed properly, could lead to a split, and the project being forked. And if the community is too fragmented after the split, both projects risk being abandoned. . 5.5 Questions: . In my opinion, copyright and the right to both property and intellectual property are both very importnat and deserve to be portected. It is important to make sure that people do not every interfere with other people’s code and that everyone should be able to have a right to keep their property and intelllectual property for themselves for both privacy and monetary reasons. Not having these protections will create a toxic environment on the internet and will award cheating, plagiralism, which are not good stuff for society. Another question talked about how to control these copyright and stealing of intellectual studd That comes with a ton of advantages, including low-cost investment, better innovation, smarter learning, and easy bug removal tracking, and more. However, open-source software carries certain disadvantages as well, including no constant support, slighter riskiness, and non-friendly nature of the software. . 5.6 Safe Computing . Computer security is important because it keeps your information protected. It’s also important for your computer’s overall health; proper computer security helps prevent viruses and malware, which allows programs to run quicker and smoother. Protect Yourself from Computer viruses, spyware, scams &amp; spam. Computer viruses, spyware, and spam not only disrupt your work day with computer and network problems, but can result in identity theft. The main methods you can use to keep your computer safe are to have up to date antivirus and firewall programs, back up your data, use the Internet safely, protect your data by using secure connections and protecting sensitive data, and keep your computer and information safe by using strong passwords and controlling. Computing is any goal-oriented activity requiring, benefiting from, or creating computing machinery. It includes the study and experimentation of algorithmic processes, and development of both hardware and software. Computing has scientific, engineering, mathematical, technological and social aspects. Computer security has three main goals: Confidentiality: Making sure people cannot acquire information they should not (keeping secrets) Integrity: Making sure people cannot change information they should not (protecting data) Availability: Making sure people cannot stop the computer from doing its job. The Health and Safety (Display Screen Equipment) Regulations 1992 set out how employers should handle the risk of working with computer equipment. These regulations place obligations on employers whose employees use display screen equipment (e.g. computers and laptops) daily for continuous periods of an hour or more. Confidentiality, integrity and availability, also known as the CIA triad, is a model designed to guide policies for information security within an organization. .",

            "content": "Purpose: Help students streamline and make their coding experience easier through built in packages and methods from a library Objective: By the end of the lesson, students should be able to fluently use methods from the turtle and math packages, and be able to look up documentation for any python package and us it. . fill in the blanks! . Libraries . Okay, so we&#39;ve learned a lot of code, and all of you now can boast that you can code at least some basic programs in python. But, what about more advanced stuff? What if there&#39;s a more advanced program you don&#39;t know how to make? Do you need to make it yourself? Well, not always. . You&#39;ve already learned about functions that you can write to reuse in your code in previous lessons. But,there are many others who code in python just like you. So why would you do again what someone has already done, and is available for any python user? . Packages allow a python user to import methods from a library, and use the methods in their code. Most libraries come with documentation on the different methods they entail and how to use them, and they can be found with a quick google search. methods are used with the following: . Note: a method from a package can only be used after the import statement. . Some libraries are always installed, such as those with the list methods which we have previously discussed. But others require a special python keyword called import. We will learn different ways to import in Challenge 1. . Sometimes we only need to import a single method from the package. We can do that with the word &quot;from&quot;, followed by the package name, then the word &quot;import&quot;, then the method. This will alllow you to use the method without mentioning the package&#39;s name, unlike what we did before, however other methods from that package cannot be used. To get the best of both worlds you can use &quot;*&quot;. . To import a method as an easier name, just do what we did first, add the word &quot;as&quot;, and write the name you would like to use that package as. . Challenge 1: Basic Libraries . Find a python package on the internet and import it | Choose a method from the package and import only the method | import the package as a more convenient name. | from math import atan ### Importing only the method atan from math num1 = atan(5) ### Setting the variable print(num1) . 1.373400766945016 . Challenge 2: Turtle . Turtle is a python drawing library which allows you to draw all kinds of different shapes. It&#39;s ofter used to teach beginning python learners, but is really cool to use anywhere. Turtle employs a graphics package to display what you&#39;ve done, but unfortunately it&#39;s kind of annoying to make work with vscode. Use: repl.it Click &quot;+ Create&quot;, and for language, select &quot;Python (with Turtle)&quot; Documentation Task: Have fun with turtle! Create something that uses at least 2 lines of different lengths and 2 turns with different angles, and changes at least one setting about either the pen or canvas. Also use one command that isn&#39;t mentioned on the table below(there are a lot). Paste a screenshot of the code and the drawing from repl.it . Commands . forward(pixels) | . right(degrees) | . left(degrees) | . setpos(x,y) | . speed(speed) | . pensize(size) | . pencolor(color) | . Note: Color should be within quotes, like &quot;brown&quot;, or &quot;red&quot; . from turtle import * oogway = turtle.Turtle() for i in range(4): oogway.forward(50) oogway.right(90) turtle.done() ### Image is on the link .

Homework: Putting it all together(complete only after the random values lesson) . Option 1: Create a python program which generates a random number between 1 and 10, and use turtle to draw a regular polygon with that many sides. As a hint, remember that the total sum of all the angles in a polygon is (the number of sides - 2) * 180. Note: a regular polygon has all sides and angles the same size. Paste a screenshot of the code and the drawing from repl.it . Option 2: use the &quot;datetime&quot; package, and looking up documentation, create a program to generate 2 random dates and find the number of days between . Extra ideas: customize the settings, draw a picture, or something else! . .",

True False . ASCII: ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) is the most common character encoding format for text data in computers and on the internet. Unicode: Unicode is the universal character encoding used to process, store and facilitate the interchange of text data in any language RGB: RGB (red, green, and blue) refers to a system for representing the colors to be used on a computer display. Lossy: In lossy compression, the data in a file is removed and not restored to its original form after decompression. . Unit 3 ... Algorithm/Programming Terms . Variables: a value that can change, depending on conditions or on information passed to the program. Data Types: A data type is a classification of data which tells the compiler or interpreter how the programmer intends to use the data. Most programming languages support various types of data, including integer, real, character or string, and Boolean. Assignment Operations: Assignment Operations are the different mathematical operations which can be done on computer programming . a = 1 print(a) ### Different Data Types y = 5&gt;4 ### Example of a boolean x = 10 ### Example of an intger z = 10.551234 ### Example of a float num = &quot;string&quot; ### Example of a string print(x) print(y) print(z) print(num) ### Assignment operations b = 1 c = 2 d = b * c ### Example of a mathermical operation where variable b and c are multiplied to each other print(d) . 1 10 True 10.551234 string 2 . Managing Complexity with Variables: Complexity management is the ability to analyse, review, and optimize complexity in organizations using variables, lists, and dictionaries lists: lists are defined with name, then can be accessed using different methods. dictionary: Dictionaries have a key and value pair method, with a key given and value given in the output. sequences: An iterable is a collection of objects where you can get each element one by one. Therefore, any sequence is iterable. For example, a list is iterable. Selection: allows a program to test several conditions and execute instructions based on which condition is true. . numbers = [1, 2, 5] print(numbers) ### Example of a dictionary in python capital_city = {&quot;Nepal&quot;: &quot;Kathmandu&quot;, &quot;Italy&quot;: &quot;Rome&quot;, &quot;England&quot;: &quot;London&quot;} print(capital_city) ### Example of a sequence in python: cities = [&#39;San Francisco&#39;, &#39;New York&#39;, &#39;Washington DC&#39;] print(len(cities)) ### Example of a sequential statement a=20 b=10 c=a-b print(&quot;Subtraction is : &quot;,c) .

Iteration: In programming specifically, iterative refers to a sequence of instructions or code being repeated until a specific end result is achieved. Expression: An expression in Python is a combination of operators and operands. Comparision Operators: Comparision Operators are ways to compare two diffent values, mostly integers and floats. Booleans Expressions and Selection: A Boolean expression is a logical statement that is either TRUE or FALSE . Truth Tables: A truth table is a way of summarising and checking the logic of a circuit. String Concatenation: In formal language theory and computer programming, string concatenation is the operation of joining character strings end-to-end. Traversing Strings: Traversing a string means accessing all the elements of the string one after the other by using the subscript. . a = [&#39;foo&#39;, &#39;bar&#39;, &#39;baz&#39;] for i in a: print(i) ### Example of using operaiton operators in python: b = 5 c = 6 if(b&gt;c): print(&quot;False&quot;) else: print(&quot;True&quot;) ### Example of boolean expressions booleanex = 5&gt;6 print(booleanex) ### Example of boolean iteration in python: num = [5, 6, 7] for i in num: print(i &gt; 5) ### This will print out for every object in num, it will check if it is greater than 5, iterate through the list then print if it is true or false ### Example of String Concatenation x = &quot;Python is &quot; y = &quot;awesome&quot; z = x + y print(z) ### Example of Traversing Strings # Python program to iterate over characters of a string # Code #1 string_name = &quot;ShivanshGoel&quot; # Iterate over the string for element in string_name: print(element, end=&#39; &#39;) print(&quot; n&quot;) # Code #2 string_name = &quot;SHIVANSH&quot; # Iterate over index for element in range(0, len(string_name)): print(string_name[element]) . foo bar baz True False False True True Python is awesome S h i v a n s h G o e l S H I V A N S H .

If the condition is true, the if block code is executed and if the condition is false, the else block code is executed. . def findMax(numA, numB): if numA&gt;numB: print(numA) elif numA==numB: print(&quot;Number A is equal to Number B&quot;) else: print(numB) result = findMax(5, 6) print(result) def findMin(numC, numD): if numC&gt;numD: print(numD) elif numC==numD: print(&quot;Number A is equal to Number B&quot;) else: print(numC) result = findMin(5, 6) . Nested Conditionals: There are two main ways to make a nested if statement. The first option is to put the if statement inside an if code block. The other option is to place the if statement in the else code of an if/else statement. . itemsOrdered = 30 itemsInStock = 32 print(&quot;Got an order for&quot;, itemsOrdered, &quot;items. In stock:&quot;, itemsInStock) # Compare order size against inventory if itemsOrdered &gt;= itemsInStock: print(&quot;Resupply the inventory. We&#39;re running out!&quot;) else: packageCount = round(itemsOrdered / 8) if packageCount &gt; 1: print(&quot;We need multiple packages to fulfill this order!&quot;) . Got an order for 30 items. In stock: 32 We need multiple packages to fulfil this order! . Python Loops: Looping means repeating something over and over until a particular condition is satisfied. A for loop in Python is a control flow statement that is used to repeatedly execute a group of statements as long as the condition is satisfied. . fruits = [&quot;apple&quot;, &quot;banana&quot;, &quot;cherry&quot;] for x in fruits: print(x) if x == &quot;banana&quot;: break ### While loop in python: i = 1 while i &lt; 6: print(i) i += 1 ### . Procedural Abstraction: Procedural abstraction is when we write code sections (called &quot;procedures&quot; or in Java, &quot;static methods&quot;) which are generalised by having variable parameters. Procedure: is a named group of programming instructions that may have parameters and return values. Parameters: input values of a procedure. The value that a function returns to the caller is generally known as the function&#39;s return value. All Python functions have a return value, either explicit or implicit. . def my_function(fname, lname): ### Theese are the paramters &quot;fname&quot;, &quot;lname&quot; print(fname + &quot; &quot; + lname) my_function(&quot;Shivansh&quot;, &quot;Goel&quot;) ### These are the return values .

Random numbers are numbers that are generated using a large set of numbers and a mathematical algorithm that gives equal probability to every number that occurs. | Generating random numbers programmatically means that different runs may produce different results. | . What are Random Values? . Random Values are a number generated using a large set of numbers and a mathematical algorithm which gives equal probability to all number occuring . Each Result from randomization is equally likely to occur Using random number generation in a program means each execution may produce a different result . What are Examples of Random outputs in the world? Add a few you can think of. . Ex: Marbles | . Why do we need Random Values for code? . We Need Random Values for Code: The advantage of using mathematics to generate a random number (sequence) is that it is REPEATABLE. This is important for the following reason: debugging a program. Imagine the problems you already have finding errors in your code. What would happen if the &quot;path&quot; (or program flow) was different (random) every time? .

Purpose: Help students streamline and make their coding experience easier through built in packages and methods from a library Objective: By the end of the lesson, students should be able to fluently use methods from the turtle and math packages, and be able to look up documentation for any python package and us it. . fill in the blanks! . Libraries . Okay, so we&#39;ve learned a lot of code, and all of you now can boast that you can code at least some basic programs in python. But, what about more advanced stuff? What if there&#39;s a more advanced program you don&#39;t know how to make? Do you need to make it yourself? Well, not always. . You&#39;ve already learned about functions that you can write to reuse in your code in previous lessons. But,there are many others who code in python just like you. So why would you do again what someone has already done, and is available for any python user? . Packages allow a python user to import methods from a library, and use the methods in their code. Most libraries come with documentation on the different methods they entail and how to use them, and they can be found with a quick google search. methods are used with the following: . Note: a method from a package can only be used after the import statement. . Some libraries are always installed, such as those with the list methods which we have previously discussed. But others require a special python keyword called import. We will learn different ways to import in Challenge 1. . Sometimes we only need to import a single method from the package. We can do that with the word &quot;from&quot;, followed by the package name, then the word &quot;import&quot;, then the method. This will alllow you to use the method without mentioning the package&#39;s name, unlike what we did before, however other methods from that package cannot be used. To get the best of both worlds you can use &quot;*&quot;. . To import a method as an easier name, just do what we did first, add the word &quot;as&quot;, and write the name you would like to use that package as. . Challenge 1: Basic Libraries . Find a python package on the internet and import it | Choose a method from the package and import only the method | import the package as a more convenient name. | from math import atan ### Importing only the method atan from math num1 = atan(5) ### Setting the variable print(num1) . 1.373400766945016 . Challenge 2: Turtle . Turtle is a python drawing library which allows you to draw all kinds of different shapes. It&#39;s ofter used to teach beginning python learners, but is really cool to use anywhere. Turtle employs a graphics package to display what you&#39;ve done, but unfortunately it&#39;s kind of annoying to make work with vscode. Use: repl.it Click &quot;+ Create&quot;, and for language, select &quot;Python (with Turtle)&quot; Documentation Task: Have fun with turtle! Create something that uses at least 2 lines of different lengths and 2 turns with different angles, and changes at least one setting about either the pen or canvas. Also use one command that isn&#39;t mentioned on the table below(there are a lot). Paste a screenshot of the code and the drawing from repl.it . Commands . forward(pixels) | . right(degrees) | . left(degrees) | . setpos(x,y) | . speed(speed) | . pensize(size) | . pencolor(color) | . Note: Color should be within quotes, like &quot;brown&quot;, or &quot;red&quot; . from turtle import * oogway = turtle.Turtle() for i in range(4): oogway.forward(50) oogway.right(90) turtle.done() ### Image is on the link .

Homework: Putting it all together(complete only after the random values lesson) . Option 1: Create a python program which generates a random number between 1 and 10, and use turtle to draw a regular polygon with that many sides. As a hint, remember that the total sum of all the angles in a polygon is (the number of sides - 2) * 180. Note: a regular polygon has all sides and angles the same size. Paste a screenshot of the code and the drawing from repl.it . Option 2: use the &quot;datetime&quot; package, and looking up documentation, create a program to generate 2 random dates and find the number of days between .

            "title": "Searching Introduction",
            "content": "What is searching? . In certain computer programs and applications, one might find the need to locate and retrieve a data value and/or it&#39;s index. Searching algorithms could be done in either intervals or sequences, and certain algorithms could be more efficient than others, with benefits and drawbacks to each. . The Naive Approach . The most intuitively obvious solution to the searching problem is to sequentialy check each successful value in the data structure until either a matching value is found, or the entire structure has been transversed. This thought process could be explained graphically in this example . This algorithm could also be expressed in code, as shown below. . def sequentialSearch(arr, target): N = len(arr) # Declare N as length of array for i in range(N): # Iterate over the list if arr[i] == target: # Check for match return i # Match found, return index and end function call return -1 # Element not found . Sequential Search - Larger Inputs . Although for selection sort is seemingly fast for smaller inputs, it is clear that it cannot keep up with increasing input sizes. Because sequential search checks every value of the given array, the algorithm&#39;s overall runtime increases &quot;linearly&quot; with the input size. . i.e. Pretend that one check takes one second, and that we are searching for the last element in an array. If the array length is 4, it would take 4 seconds to find the last element, whereas if the array length is 86400 indices long, it would take a whole day to find the element. . Hence, although selection sort is known for its simplicity, it is unfeasible for large inputs . Below, we have created three sorted lists of length 100,1000000,100000000. . import time arr1 = [i for i in range(100)] arr2 = [i for i in range(1000000)] arr3 = [i for i in range(100000000)] . To analyze the sequential search algorithm, we will check for the worst case scenario, where runtime is maximized. This is because when measuring the efficiency of our algorithm, we want to be able to guarantee an upper limit or set amount of time for our program to finish running. To do this, we will attempt to search for the last element in the array . print(&quot;length of list: &quot;, len(arr1)) s = time.time() print(&quot;Index: &quot;, sequentialSearch(arr1,99)) e = time.time() print(&#39;Execution time:&#39;, (e-s)*1000, &#39;ms&#39;) . length of list: 100 Index: 99 Execution time: 0.05602836608886719 ms . print(&quot;length of list: &quot;, len(arr2)) s = time.time() print(&quot;Index: &quot;, sequentialSearch(arr2,999999)) e = time.time() print(&#39;Execution time:&#39;, (e-s)*1000, &#39;ms&#39;) . length of list: 1000000 Index: 999999 Execution time: 58.67457389831543 ms . print(&quot;length of list: &quot;, len(arr3)) s = time.time() print(&quot;Index: &quot;, sequentialSearch(arr3,99999999)) e = time.time() print(&#39;Execution time:&#39;, (e-s)*1000, &#39;ms&#39;) . length of list: 100000000 Index: 99999999 Execution time: 5162.384986877441 ms . As you can see, as the input list grows larger and larger, the overall runtime of the program increases linearly as well, resulting in a lower scalability for the sequential search algorithm. . Binary Search . Binary search is an efficient way to iterate through a SORTED list to find a requested value. This is done through checking the middle value of a list and checking if the requested value is greater than or less than the middle value. You can start to see why the requested list must be sorted. If the list is not sorted, this logic is flawed, and the binary search algorithm will no longer work. . Unlike the sequential search method, binary search doesn&#39;t check for each successive element until a match is found. In every iteration the algorithm is making a binary decision; if the selected element is larger or smaller than the target. . How exactly does this work? Lets look at these amazing ms paint drawings: . i was too lazy to make a third so ur gonna have to live with 2 :) . This algorithm is extremely efficient as the maximum number of cycles in binary search is equal to log base 2 of the closest, next power of two, to length of list. . If the array is 8 items long, the maximum possible cycles would be 3 (log base 2 of 8 is 3) . If the array is 7 items long, the maximum possible cycles would STILL be 3 as the closest power of 2 to 7 is 8. . If the array is 9 items long, the maximum possible cycles INCREASES to 4, as the closest, next power of two, is 16. . def binarySearch(array, target): # Parameters: array is the given array and target is what we are looking for low = 0 # the starting lower bound high = len(array)-1 # the starting upper bound while high &gt;= low: # we will keep running until we run out of possible subarrays... mid = (high + low) // 2 # define the middle of the list to be the item at the index of the average of the lower and upper bound if array[mid] == target: # if item is in the middle of the list... we found what we are looking for! return mid # therefore, we return the index of where we found the item. elif array[mid] &gt; target: # if item is less than the middle of the list, this must mean that the item is on the lower half of the list high = mid-1 # therefore, we set the upper bound of the search to be the last item of the lower half else: # if item is neither less than or equal to the middle of the list, this must mean that the item is on the upper half of the list low = mid+1 # therefore, we set the lower bound of the search to be the first item of the upper half # if nothing is returned by the time the while loop ends, that means item MUST be missing from list return False # therefore we tell the user that the requested item was not found . Likewise, we can also take a recursive approach to this problem, note the similarities . def BinarySearchRecursion(arr, target, lo, hi): if lo &gt; hi: return False mid = (lo+hi)//2 if arr[mid] == target: return mid elif arr[mid] &gt; target: return BinarySearchRecursion(arr, target, lo, mid-1) elif arr[mid] &lt; target: return BinarySearchRecursion(arr, target, mid+1, hi) . Now, let&#39;s compare the runtime with the same lists we tried with the sequential search algorithm. . print(&quot;length of list: &quot;, len(arr1)) s = time.time() print(&quot;Index: &quot;, binarySearch(arr1,99)) e = time.time() print(&#39;Execution time:&#39;, (e-s)*1000, &#39;ms&#39;) . length of list: 100 Index: 99 Execution time: 0.05507469177246094 ms . print(&quot;length of list: &quot;, len(arr2)) s = time.time() print(&quot;Index: &quot;, binarySearch(arr2,999999)) e = time.time() print(&#39;Execution time:&#39;, (e-s)*1000, &#39;ms&#39;) . length of list: 1000000 Index: 999999 Execution time: 0.17070770263671875 ms . print(&quot;length of list: &quot;, len(arr3)) s = time.time() print(&quot;Index: &quot;, binarySearch(arr3,99999999)) e = time.time() print(&#39;Execution time:&#39;, (e-s)*1000, &#39;ms&#39;) . length of list: 100000000 Index: 99999999 Execution time: 0.06628036499023438 ms . arr4 = [1,4,5,8,10,13,145,1938] print(&quot;Index: &quot;, binarySearch(arr4,17)) .

Conditionals vs Booleans . Conditionals and booleans can be equivalent. . For example, let&#39;s say there are two booleans: rainy and sunny. . Let&#39;s look at the following code: . sunny = true; rainy = false; . false . if (sunny) { umbrella = false; } else if (rainy) { umbrella = true; } else { umbrella = false; } console.log(umbrella); . false . The code above is the same as below: . umbrella = !sunny &amp;&amp; rainy; console.log(umbrella); . false . To determine if two conditionals and booleans are the same, you can substitute the four possibilities that the two booleans (sunny and rainy) can be (listed below) into the conditional and boolean and see if both cases match: . sunny = true, rainy = true . sunny = true, rainy = false . sunny = false, rainy = true . sunny = false, rainy = false . Challenge . Using JavaScript, create an algorithm that takes in an IP address and a subnet mask and computes the network address. . Overview . As we&#39;ve seen in Unit 4.1, an IP address is a 32 bit number that uniquely identifies each device. (See this for a recap). Something extra is that an IP address also comes with a subnet mask. A subnet mask is also a 32 bit number that identifies what network an IP address in in through a process that uses the bitwise AND. . In ANDing: . 0 + 0 = 0 . 0 + 1 = 0 . 1 + 0 = 0 . 1 + 1 = 1 . The following are the steps to determine the network that an IP address is in given the subnet mask: . Example: IP address: 192.168.0.1 . Subnet mask: 255.255.255.0 . Convert the IP address into binary: 192.168.0.1 -&gt; 11000000.10101000.00000000.00000001 | Convert the subnet mask into binary: 255.255.255.0 -&gt; 11111111.11111111.11111111.00000000 | Do a bitwise AND operation on the binary IP address and subnet mask: | 11000000.10101000.00000000.00000001 +11111111.11111111.11111111.00000000 =11000000.10101000.00000000.00000000 . Convert the result back to decimal: 11000000.10101000.00000000.00000000 -&gt; 192.168.0.0 | The network address is 192.168.0.0 .

            "content": "Algorithms can be written in different ways and still accomplish the same tasks. Algorithms that look similar often yield differnet outputs. To solve the same problem, many different algorithms can be used. . Therefore, algorithms are very important for programmers, and today we&#39;re going to explore how to determine the outcome of algorithms, how to deteremine the output of similar algorithms, how to edit existing algorithms, and how to develop our own algorithms. . Determine the outcome of algorithms . Consider the following algorithm. . def mystery(num, num2): if (num % num2 == 0): print(&quot;True&quot;) else: print(&quot;False&quot;) mystery(20, 4) . True . What does the algorithm do? Please explain in words. | What if I put in 30 as num and 4 as num2. What would be the output? | The algorithm defines a function with two variables num and num2. Then there is an if and else statement where if num1 divded by num2 has no remainder then it will print true and if it does not it will print false. . Determine the outcome of similar algorithms . The output of this algorithm is &quot;It is too hot ouside&quot; . temp = 95 if (temp &gt;= 90): print(&quot;it is too hot outside&quot;) else: if (temp &gt;= 65): print(&quot;I will go outside&quot;) else: print(&quot;it is too cold outside&quot;) . it is too hot outside . The output of this algorithm includes another line which says &quot;i will go outside&quot; . temp = 95 if (temp &gt;= 90): print(&quot;it is too hot outside&quot;) if (temp &gt;= 65): print(&quot;i will go outside&quot;) if (temp &lt; 65): print(&quot;it is too cold outside&quot;) . it is too hot outside i will go outside . Editing Algorithms . Task: Please edit the algorithm above to have it yield the same results as the previous algorithm! (no matter what temp you put in) . Developing Algorithms . To develop algorithms, we first need to understand what the question is asking. Then, think about how you would approach it as a human and then try to find what pattern you went through to arrive at the answer. Apply this to code, and there you have it! An algorithm! . Let&#39;s say you wanted to sum up the first five integers. How would you do this in real life? Your thought process would probably be: . The sum of the first integer is 1. | Then, increase that integer by 1. I now add 2 to my existing sum (1). My new sum is 3. | Repeat until I add 5 to my sum. The resulting sum is 15. | . Now let&#39;s translate this into code. . sum = 0 # start with a sum of 0 for i in range (1, 6): # you will repeat the process five times for integers 1-5 sum = sum + i # add the number to your sum print(sum) # print the result . 15 . Task: Write an algorithm in python that sums up the first 5 odd integers. You can use the following code as a starter. . sum = 0 counter = 1 for i in range (0, 5): sum = sum + counter counter = counter + 2 print(sum) . 25 . Homework . Create an algorithm that will start with any positive integer n and display the full sequence of numbers that result from the Collatz Conjecture. The COllatz Conjecture is as follows: . start with any positive integer | if the number is even, divide by 2 | if the number is odd, multiply by 3 and add 1 | repeat steps 2 and 3 until you reach 1 | Example: if the starting number was 6, the output would be 6, 3, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1 . sum = 0 for i in range (1, 6): sum = sum + i if sum % 2 == 0: sum print(sum) .",

Once you&#39;ve done this with one of the types of loops discussed in this lesson, create a function that does the same thing with a different type of loop. . binarylist = [ &quot;01001001&quot;, &quot;10101010&quot;, &quot;10010110&quot;, &quot;00110111&quot;, &quot;11101100&quot;, &quot;11010001&quot;, &quot;10000001&quot; ] def binary_convert(binary): i = 0 num = [] while i &lt; len(binary): if (int(binary[i], 2) &lt;= 100): num.append(int(binary[i], 2)) i += 1 return num decimallist = binary_convert(binarylist) print(decimallist) def binary_convert2(binary): num = [] for x in range(0, len(binary)): if (int(binary[x], 2) &lt;= 100): num.append(int(binary[x], 2)) return num decimallist2 = binary_convert2(binarylist) print(decimallist2) #use this function to convert every binary value in binarylist to decimal #afterward, get rid of the values that are greater than 100 in decimal #when done, print the results . [73, 55] [73, 55] . What Happened . I couldnt&#39; complete this challenge, but what I could try to accomplish was coding for making sure that all the values are smaller than 100 and tried to get the binary function to work. .",

Here are the some reasons that were listed: Engineering can be used pretty much everywhere, and I hope that me and my peers can use the concepts of engineering to solve problems to make a positive impact in the world. They also followed a logical thought process and engineers are very important in society. Then the speakers talked about the different streams of engineering. The various streams were: electronics, Robotics, Communication, Aeronautics, Industrial, Computer Science, Mechanical, Structural, Civil Engineering, Electronics. Suma Latha took communication engineering for her stream and also focused on computer science and electronics. After User graduated the user went to a job relating communication engineering which related to computer engineering (ARozn aand Qualcom). Then we started talking about what Qualcomm is currently doing. This is the stuff that they said that are currently going on: QUALCOMM makes a lot of the mobile technoiogy and is working on 5g, qualcomm makes chips and wireless technology, mobile phone chips,Makes processors, Qualcomm creates services related to networking and wireless technology. | . Second Paragraph: . Nisha Seitha talked about her path to becoming an engineer. Choose Engineering as a factor of Father also being there. One of the only girls entered STEM at a place. Chose Engineering because she was very good at math and also chose computers because it was very rare and unique. 4 years of engineering college dreaming about a hardware engineer designer. But in the end became a software engineer. Landed 1st job in a computer science company. Worked on 3d Engineering of a comp[any then started working as a software engineer. Worked at the headquarters of the company and joined Qualcoom and worked in the 4th generation project. Right now working in the 5th generation project at Qualcomm. They also talked about the important stuff for getting into good engineering universities. Taking a lot of AP courses and making sure that GPA is very high. Also joining courses and robotics to show interest in engineering. Take advantage of any programs which can help you for engineering`. | . Conclusion Paragraph: I gained a lot of insight into engineering and computer science from the speakers in this Zoom meeting who are QUALCOMM employees. I gained knowledge about the specific projects that QUALCOMM is working on, the key ones being networking, wireless technology, and mobile technology. Additionally, I developed an awareness of engineering’s functions and international applications. I can now understand how engineering is applied in all aspects of life, from straightforward operations like setting an alarm to more complex ones like launching a rocket. It is nearly impossible to discover something that does not use engineering or computer science in some form, as they are practically ubiquitous.Additionally, with the speakers’ advice, I was capable of recognizing the path I can take to assist myself develop into a good software developer in the future, particularly working in significant IT firms like Google and QUALCOMM.

            "content": "Alumni Panel Notes . Introduction . Mostly all graduates to UCs | Some of them are not majoring in computer science | . Question 1: Biggest Challenge in Computer Science? . Keeping motivation | A lot of problems and hard to find on the internet | Focus on your own path and try to not to compare with others | Try to ignore clashing egos | Hard finding motivation because of smarter people | Have a better mindset to learn instead of just trying to get stuff down | Getting started in coding is very hard | . Question 2: Are there any PBL scenarios in college computer science classes? . There are 2 PBL scenarios in college. 1 of them is defineftly in senior year Project based learning classes and some theory based classes. | There are a lot of PBL exams which are definite for computer silence | A lot of group based and managing group. Be Careful of getting used for doing too much group work. | Be good at managing work | . Question 3: Have you applied CS in your major if you are not majoring in CS? . There is a lot of coding involved in mechanical engineering which will help you out a lot. | Optimizing things are also very well used in a lot of different majors | Computer science can help with very high level math | A lot of requirements in Stats courses and psychology courses need some type of Computer Science | Programming is almost everywhere in a lot of STEM majors | . Question 4: For existing college students have you had a job with school or professor? . Getting internships and talking to professors will help get better jobs. | Try to be unique from the 200 other students in the college lecture | 2 of the alumnis had Internships in Northrop Grumman | 1 of the alumni had Internships in a company doing APIs and web development | . Other Questions: . Doing 2 or 3 personal projects will help out with applying for internships and stuff Path finding algorithms (Graph Theory, etc) a lot of data visualization | Doing a lot of data application in projects and classes | Club called Trident A in UCSD | When trying to apply for internships always have a resume | .",
