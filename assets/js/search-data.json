Keeping motivation | A lot of problems and hard to find on the internet | Focus on your own path and try to not to compare with others | Try to ignore clashing egos | Hard finding motivation because of smarter people | Have a better mindset to learn instead of just trying to get stuff down | Getting started in coding is very hard | . Question 2: Are there any PBL scenarios in college computer science classes? . There are 2 PBL scenarios in college. 1 of them is defineftly in senior year Project based learning classes and some theory based classes. | There are a lot of PBL exams which are definite for computer silence | A lot of group based and managing group. Be Careful of getting used for doing too much group work. | Be good at managing work | . Question 3: Have you applied CS in your major if you are not majoring in CS? . There is a lot of coding involved in mechanical engineering which will help you out a lot. | Optimizing things are also very well used in a lot of different majors | Computer science can help with very high level math | A lot of requirements in Stats courses and psychology courses need some type of Computer Science | Programming is almost everywhere in a lot of STEM majors | . Question 4: For existing college students have you had a job with school or professor? . Getting internships and talking to professors will help get better jobs. | Try to be unique from the 200 other students in the college lecture | 2 of the alumnis had Internships in Northrop Grumman | 1 of the alumni had Internships in a company doing APIs and web development | . Other Questions: . Doing 2 or 3 personal projects will help out with applying for internships and stuff Path finding algorithms (Graph Theory, etc) a lot of data visualization | Doing a lot of data application in projects and classes | Club called Trident A in UCSD | When trying to apply for internships always have a resume | .",
