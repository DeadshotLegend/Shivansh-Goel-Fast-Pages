<ul>
  <li>Effective collobaration produces a computing innovation that reflects the diversity of talents and perspectives of those who designed it.</li>
  <li>Collobaration that includes diverse perspectives helps avoid bias in the development of computing innovations.</li>
  <li>Effective colloborative teams practice interspersonal skills, including, but not limited to:
    <ul>
      <li>Communiation</li>
      <li>Consenseus Building</li>
      <li>Conflict Resolution</li>
      <li>Negotiation</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>A Computing innovation includes a program as an integral part of its function.</li>
  <li>A computing innovation can be physical, nonpyhysical computing osftware, or a nonphysical computing concept (e-commerce).</li>
  <li>Collobarations that inclues diverse perspectives helps avoid bias in the development of computing innovations.</li>

    <p>African Proverb: “If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together.”</p>
  </li>
  <li>Essential Knowledge
    <ul>
      <li>Consultation and communication with users are important aspects of the development of computing innovations</li>
      <li>Information gathered from potential users can be used to understand the purpose of a program from diverse perspectives and to develop a program that fully incorporates these perspectives</li>
      <li>Online tools support collobaration by allowing programmers to share and provide feedback on ideas and doucmentws</li>
      <li>Common models such as pair programming exist to facilitate collaboration.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Pair Programming: Two programmers work together as a pair. One (the driver) writes program code, while the other review each line of program code as it is typed in.</li>
  <li>Think - Pair - Share: Students think through a problem alone, pair with a partner to share ideas, and then share with the rest of the class.</li>
  <li>Make sure to leave comments in code</li>
  <li>Online tools: (repl.it, Github)</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>What I will learn The essential about computing innovations The purpose of computing innovations What are Computing Innovations Aplications like games and social media Physical devices like computers and cell phones Systems like email, ecommerce and cloud services Innovations solve problems Video 2 What I will learn The inputs and outputs of a program Data of the outputs related to that program Types of input Touch Audio Visual Text/numerical values Event Driven Enviornments Most programs have event driven environments Mouse clicks Swipes Button click Keyboard clicks Audio trigger Video 3 What I will Learn I will learn the functions of a program What is a Program A program is a single command</li>

<p>Video 1.3.1</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>How is a program developed</p>

    <ul>
      <li>it is developed with an IdeaT</li>
      <li>Then the problem it was based on is investigated</li>
      <li>Also we have to talk about constraints</li>
      <li>Observation w surveys</li>
      <li>Plan Out design and organize tasks</li>
      <li>Make prototypes and test</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Video 1.3.2</p>

<p>Acknowledging Code Segments</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>It is important to acknowledge code actors
Program isnt solo
Each member deserves to get credit for their work and contributions
Names must be written in documentation of the program
When there is a problem the people who developed it can fix it
Even though they might not be apart of the project they deserve to be credited
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Video 1.3.3</p>

<p>How developments are created</p>

<p>-Programers use documentation and other things to describe the function of the program</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>documentation is important because it makes you more efficient and it makes sense when you need to look back at what you did
Comments are used with a # in python and a // in java
</code></pre></div></div>
