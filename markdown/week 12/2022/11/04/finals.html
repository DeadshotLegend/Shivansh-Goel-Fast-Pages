<ul>
  <li>This project was made by Noor, Steven, Ederick, Alan,, and Liav</li>
  <li>The basic overview of the program was: “A scheduling program that allows you to check the weather while displaying the eents that you want to host on a given day”.</li>
  <li>Stuff that I liked: I really liked their idea and their aiblity to put it into fruition.</li>
  <li>Stuff that I didn’t like: I didn’t like their API and how it kind of related with their idea.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>This project was based off the Scrum Daddys by Orlando, Ethan, Colin, and Jaden</li>
  <li>The project uses a weather API to gather information and display it on an alternate portfolio. The information ets updated every hour and displays accurate information while having sleek design.</li>

<ul>
  <li>I reviewed over the products made rom the 3D Arts and Animations which the produced in paper. I thought that it was really interesting and colorful which makes me thing that this might be a class that I would want to do in the future.</li>
