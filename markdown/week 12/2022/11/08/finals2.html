<ul>
  <li>I did very good on the internet questions, because of the thoughtul notes that I took on the videos.</li>
  <li>I also did very good code reading which I presume comes from a good background of coding</li>
  <li>I did very good in the colloboration questions

<h3 id="what-i-did-bad-in">
<a class="anchor" href="#what-i-did-bad-in" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What I did bad in</h3>
<ul>
  <li>I wasn’t very good at the binary coding and understanding the proramming methods.</li>
  <li>Psuedo code was also pretty hard to understand, comprehend, and then answer questions based off them</li>
  <li>I was also not very good at evaulting programs and testing them off through comprehensio questions.</li>
</ul>

<a class="anchor" href="#what-i-can-do-to-improve" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What I can do to improve</h3>
<ul>
  <li>What I can do to improve is start watching vidoes on binary reading and learn how and what to do in computational programmin.</li>
  <li>I can start to do more problems in psuedo code, to strength my knowledge of programming.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="individual-questions-that-i-did-wrong">
<a class="anchor" href="#individual-questions-that-i-did-wrong" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Individual Questions that I did Wrong</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Question 2: I switched up true and false in the equation</li>
  <li>Question 20: I need to start working on bits and understanding memory</li>
  <li>Question 21: I need to learn about binary sequences</li>
  <li>Question 28: I exchanged variables within the question, so next time I need to be more careful</li>
  <li>Question 30: I didn’t put in the correct benefit for list, to improve I will reasearch the benefits of using a list</li>
  <li>Question 35: I didn’t set the maxPS based on time, to improve on this I must read the directions more carfully.</li>
  <li>Question 36: I exchanged the evenlist or oddlist, to improve this  Ihave to be mroe careful.</li>
  <li>Question 43: I didn’t read the entire question, and I missed the block part which was supposed to be repeated</li>
</ul>
