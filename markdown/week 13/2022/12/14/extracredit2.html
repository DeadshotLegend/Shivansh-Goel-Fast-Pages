<h3 id="reflection">Reflection</h3>
<p>My Reflection on this panel was that ther are a lot of different ways to make an impact on the tehcnical industry. There are various paths and ways that one can become successful in this industry, so if something bad happens one should never quit. It is important that poeple in the technical industry should never lose motivation because the speakers talked about persistence and how even though that they failed key classes they never gave up to reach their dreams. I also learned about different colledges and projejcts that I can do to familiarilze myself with the technical indsutry including software engineering. I also learned a lot about what people do at Qualcommm and what they are engineering there. Lastly, I learned a lot about what colledges are imortant and good for the technical industry especially software engineering</p>
