if conditionA:
  # Code here executes when ‘conditionA’ is True
else:
  # Code that runs when ‘conditionA’ is False</p>

    <p>if conditionB:
      # Code that runs when ‘conditionA’ is False
      # and ‘conditionB’ is True</p>
  </li>
  <li>Example of code:
age = 19
isGraduated = False
hasLicense = True</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="look-if-person-is-18-years-or-older">Look if person is 18 years or older</h1>

    print(“You’re 18 or older. Welcome to adulthood!”)</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>if isGraduated:
