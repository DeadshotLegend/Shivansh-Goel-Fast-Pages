</ul><p>College board performance tasks require meeting all project specifications, including written report and video adequacy and demonstration of programming ability. This includes demonstrating program objectives and functionality, managing complexity, using algorithms and procedures, testing, and providing detailed explanations to demonstrate proficiency in projects and the  AP CSP curriculum.</p>

<p>For the college board requirement I will be creating the code which takes counts the points and if there is positive or negatie points depending on the object which is clikced. Random foods will come on the screen and if the correct objects are clicked then the points will increase if the wrong foods come on the screen than the points will decrease.</p>

<p>The overall plan for creating this project is to create a fun entertainment activity which can help people with their daily life(stresses). We are planning to create different parts of the project and different procedures to make this product a workable reality. We will have weekly meetings and also have a communication center in either slack or discord. This will make sure that we can hold each other accoutnable for completing our assignments. Teamwork will be very important in our project building and to create a good project.</p>

<p>The game will work when the user logs in and/or signs up, then the user will select start and start playing right away. The user must click on “good objects” which give points and avoid blicking on “bad objects” which takes away points.</p>
