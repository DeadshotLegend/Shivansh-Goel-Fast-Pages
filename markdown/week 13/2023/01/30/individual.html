<p>Three advantages or disadvantages of CS:
Increased Efficiency and Productivity: On the one hand, computer technology has altered the way we communicate, handle data, and solve problems at work and in our daily lives. However, it has also resulted in job automation and the loss of many manual labor positions, which has reduced the number of employment prospects. Enhanced Information Access and Education: People may now access educational materials and information in ways that were before inconceivable because to the internet and computer technology. The dissemination of inaccurate and misleading information, as well as an increase in distractions and a shortening of attention spans, have all been impacted by this, though. Globalization and increased connectivity are on the rise. People may now connect and communicate in ways that were previously impractical, overcoming cultural and geographic barriers. Greater collaboration and understanding between various communities are the outcome of this, but it has also facilitated the spread of hate speech and cyberbullying and reduced in-person encounters.</p>

<h3 id="dopamine-problems">
<a class="anchor" href="#dopamine-problems" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Dopamine Problems</h3>
<p>Having too much dopamine — or too much dopamine concentrated in some parts of the brain and not enough in other parts — is linked to being more competitive, aggressive and having poor impulse control. It can lead to conditions that include ADHD, binge eating, addiction and gambling.</p>

<h3 id="digital-divide">
<a class="anchor" href="#digital-divide" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Digital Divide</h3>
<p>The digital divide is the unequal access to digital technology, including smartphones, tablets, laptops, and the internet. The digital divide creates a division and inequality around access to information and resources. Digital Divide is an important part of our society because not everyone has the same resources to do work or have the same amount of entertainmnet as others.</p>

<h3 id="digital-empowerment">
<a class="anchor" href="#digital-empowerment" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Digital Empowerment</h3>
<p>Computers can help students in school. Computer skills can lead to good jobs. Computers can be used to support personal interests and social life. Computers can help young people communicate with mentors.</p>

<h3 id="52">
<a class="anchor" href="#52" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>5.2</h3>
<p>Among the problems students have with controlling computational time is the problem of dopamine. Many problems are what I deal with because I don’t have time to maintain my attention while I have to do my schoolwork. Because games give me more dopamine than school work, my brain prefers playing video games and it gives me that feeling/impulse more than looking at textbooks. One way  to avoid playing  is to set Screen Time to limit the amount of time you spend playing games. I also devoted a certain amount of time  to my studies each day.</p>

<h3 id="blog-reflection">
<a class="anchor" href="#blog-reflection" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Blog Reflection</h3>
<p>The Reflection for this assignment is that there are a lot of people that have different devices which can affect how people interact both online and in person. People can also be affected mentally and physically due to different dopmaine given through devices. There are a lot of benfits for computerr science but there are also a lot of cons for computer science.</p>

<h3 id="53-algorithmic-bias">
<a class="anchor" href="#53-algorithmic-bias" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>5.3 Algorithmic Bias</h3>
<p><img src="/Shivansh-Goel-Fast-Pages/images/algorithmbias.PNG" width="480" alt="Changed theme to Architect">
Algorithmic bias describes systematic and repeatable errors in computer systems that lead to “unfair” results such as: B. “Privilege” one category over another in a way that is different from the algorithm’s intended function. Bias can arise from a number of factors including, but not limited to, unintended or unanticipated uses or choices regarding algorithm design, data encoding, collection, selection, or methods used to train the algorithm. . For example, algorithmic bias has been observed in search engine results and social media platforms. This stigma can have many effects, ranging from unintentional invasion of privacy to reinforcing social prejudices related to race, gender, sexuality, and ethnicity. Algorithmic bias studies are most interested in algorithms that reflect “systematic and unfair” discrimination. This bias has recently been addressed in legal frameworks such as the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (2018) and the proposed Artificial Intelligence Act (2021).</p>

<h3 id="54-is-there-discrimination-in-hp-computers">
<a class="anchor" href="#54-is-there-discrimination-in-hp-computers" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>5.4 Is there Discrimination in HP Computers</h3>
<p>In the vidoe, the HP Computer was designed to track the face of a person and follow it around. But when it was tried out by a black man, it would not work on him. Then they tried the Comptuer on a white woman where the HP Computer did what it was supposed to do. A possible explanation for why there is such a divide is because maybe when the company tested out the comptuer they only tried it on subjects who were white so they did not get enough data compilation. A solution for this would be to incorporate more test subjecst of all different races so the comptuer recognizes all demonitions of the homo sapien species.</p>

<h3 id="crowd---sourcing">
<a class="anchor" href="#crowd---sourcing" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Crowd - Sourcing</h3>
<p>Some examples of us students Crown sourcing would be github. Crowd Sourcing has multiple advantages and disadvantages. Crowdsourcing involves a large group of dispersed participants contributing or producing goods or services—including ideas, votes, micro-tasks, and finances—for payment or as volunteers. Advantages of Croudsourcing would be that a large population could help each other by sharing important pieces of informatiosn such as nonfiction, fiction, and code. Some disadvantagse of Crowdsourcing would be that there is a lot of imporant information that should be limtied but it is inot. Also, the sharing of code on Github can lead to plagirlization as well as people not learning properlty because they can just look online or at other people’s work in their various different projects. Lastly, one of the huggest disadvantage would be that there is a lot of available resources which is not supposed to be their which will only hinder the learning of the students in their various different classes.</p>

<a class="anchor" href="#55-legal-and-ethical-concerns" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>5.5 Legal and Ethical Concerns</h3>
<p>Copyright is important for making sure that other people do not have the ability to take your information.</p>
