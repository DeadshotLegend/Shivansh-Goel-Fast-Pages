| Program Purpose and Function      | 0       | 0   |  The program purpose was not defined but merely stated what the function was acheiving and what inputs and outputs that were taken. They showed solving trignometic values but did not state exactlhy why they were doing it.
| Data Abstraction   | 1        | 1      | Data Abstraction followed the college board standards and did the neccessary stuff for data abstraction. They used the neccessary college board criteria with the stuff. They are storing data about the lenghts of the traingles which meets the college board criteria. They also show classifications which is also an importnat part of the college board criteria.
| Managing Complexity   | 0        | 0      |  Managing Complexity is incorrect because they do not give an explanatio about how the program was written. The commands which they sued could have done the same things as others, for example: The use of the list could be replaced with return statements with strings thatproduce the same effect.
| Procedural Abstraction   | 1        | 1      | Procedural Abstraction met the college board criteria due to taking in 3 inputs. The inputs are direclty corrleated with the caluclations and the outputs thus meeting the college board criteria.
| Algorithm Implementation | 1        | 1      | Algorithm implementation met the college board criteria because they created a method called ratioCalculate which takes into the inputs and does the neccessary calculations for the outputs that are generated.
| Testing | 1        | 1      | Adequate Testing is showsn as they do multuiple calcualtions whith the method “ratioCaluclate” showing how they use the inputs and method to generate outputs.</p>

| :—        |    :—-:   |          :—: |  —: |
| Program Purpose and Function      | 1       | 01  |  The video shows how the program functions and how the user enters data by arranging tiles on a grid. The display of the game simulation is included in the output. Additionally, it demonstrates how the user can pause, alter, and repeat the simulation. The first three requirements for the video are met by this.
| Data Abstraction   | 1        | 1      | What is stored in the list is identified by the response. Each item in these lists holds the status of one of the  screen cells, according to the response. A 0 indicates death while a 1 indicates life. The coordinates of a cell can be determined from its position in the list, and vice versa.
| Managing Complexity   | 1        | 1     | Managing Complexity meets the necessary criteria. The answer contains code that accesses and stores the status (1 or 0) of 10,800 elements using a list to control complexity.
| Procedural Abstraction   | 1        | 1      | Procedural Abstraction meets the neccessary Criteria. The response details how the procedure operates. “This algorithm takes as inputs identification numbers for two lists,” reads the response. The second will be replaced by a copy of the first. The answer explains how this process enhances the program’s overall functionality.
| Algorithm Implementation | 1        | 1      | Algorithm Implementation meets the correct criteria of college board. The answer explains in detail how the algorithm works in steps, so perhapsNewly created. The answer says: “The algorithm uses nested if-else statements to identifyLook at the first parameter to see which list it’s being copied from. inside an if statementThere is another series of if statements to decide where to go to the list if this parameter is matched.
| Testing | 1        | 1      | The video shows the testing becuase they show multiple tests of using the inputs and method to produce the outputs</p>
