    "- Simply put, a heuristic is a problem-solving approach that utilizes a practical process (commonly referred to as “rule of thumb” or “best practice”) to produce a feasible solution that is good enough to quickly solve a particular problem and achieve immediate goals – but not necessarily an optimal solution.\n",
    "- In computer science terms efficiency is the ratio of useful work to resources (processor and storage) expended. In other words, the ratio of the output to the input of a given system.\n"

    "- Undecidable Problems are important for certain scenarios, for example: software that calculates climate any other software might error-out given a positive input, then opposite its output. If you fed this software into itself, some thing bizarre might show up. Say step one stated this system might have an error, the second one step might say no error. This proves step one became wrong, developing a paradox. Situations like this show up each day, whilst a laptop need to bet whilst to prevent loading a internet site that could by no means load. This is why net interctions will day trip if it takes too long."
