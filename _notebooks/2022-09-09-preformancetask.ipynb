    "\n",
    "- My partner and I figured out that we want to create a web page where we can quiz people or take insight on what other people have to say.\n",
    "- What we can start right now is setting up python code for interactive stuff we will have on the web page\n",
    "- We can also start creating html and markdown pages which will be very helpful for the use in the webpages\n",
    "- We can also start creating tags and links to make the webpage more operatable\n",
    "\n",
    "### Purpose and Function\n",
    "- I would create a quiz which would help with interactivity and create it with python code\n",
    "- The web pages would be created through html codes\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Abstraction\n",
    "- Creating python lists and dictionaries\n",
    "- Store into a list QuizDb and then append later on\n",
    "- At leat 10 keys will be used in this quiz\n",

    "### Managing complexity\n",
    "- Explaining the data abstraction complexity through showing the code in python\n",

    "### Procedural Abstraction\n",
    "- I will do this by implementing a fast page with tags and links\n",
    "- There will also be use of notebooks and markdown files\n",

    "### Algorithm Implementation\n",
    "- I will use sequencing and loops for algorithm implementation\n",
    "- The for loop will monitor the answers and give seperate keys for each differnet type of answer\n",

    "### Testing\n",
    "- I will test it on the data recieved from te quizes\n",
    "- The algorithm implementation will help with monitoring the data and organize it into usable data.\n"
