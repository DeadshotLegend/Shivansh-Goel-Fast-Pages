    "- A simulation is an abstraction that mimics a more complex real-world object or phenomenon. Objectives include drawing inferences without the constraints of the real world. Simulations use different sets of values ​​to reflect the changing state of real-world phenomena. \n",
    "- When developing a simulation, it is often necessary to remove certain details or simplify aspects. Simulations can often contain distortions, depending on what details or real-world elements are included or excluded. \n",
    "- Simulations allow the formulation of the considered hypotheses. The variability and randomness of the world are taken into account with the help of a random number generator\n",
